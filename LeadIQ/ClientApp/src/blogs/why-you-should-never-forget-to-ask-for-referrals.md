**Adam Kirsch gives some quick thoughts on referrals.**

Nobody knows your customers like your customers. For this reason, your leads and customers themselves can be a surprisingly effective tool for generating qualified leads. After all, even in the most competitive industries, friendships are made through conferences, networking groups and business partnerships. These connections are your opportunity.

Conferences may get you out of your usual routine, but they can also be a great place to build referral relationships.

If you have a call that doesn’t go well, or perhaps a lead that you can’t qualify, you may be able to quickly and easily replace them in your pipeline by asking for a referral to a more appropriate customer.

For example, a lead of ours too big to use our service recently referred us to a smaller colleague who signed on right away!

Alternatively, you can leverage success stories by asking a satisfied customer if they know of others who might benefit. While the latter doesn’t always play well in hyper-competitive spaces, you may be able to use this method to generate referrals for other services of products you offer.

After all, remember – the customer is always right. They know how your offerings fit into their workflow, and likely that of others with whom they’re connected. A simple referral ask can go a long way.
