  Some of our reps were asking what’s going on? It sucked. Frankly, it was super
  frustrating. After a couple of hours of analysis, we were able to determine
  what was causing the bounces. A few of our newer reps didn’t quite understand
  everything that was happening. It made me realize something.

Some of our reps were asking what’s going on? It sucked. Frankly, it was super frustrating.

After a couple of hours of analysis, we were able to determine what was causing the bounces. A few of our newer reps didn’t quite understand everything that was happening. It made me realize something.

Many of you in sales may not understand how bounces work with cold email, and why email delivery is such a huge deal with prospecting.

It turns out that we misconfigured something with our link tracking, which made our prospecting emails fail to get delivered because our prospects’ mail servers thought our one to one emails were spam.

I know for  fact some of you may have issues with your prospecting emails getting delivered, so I put together this video explaining a bunch of this stuff to the best my abilities. If you are dealing  with this issue, I explain the solution too:
