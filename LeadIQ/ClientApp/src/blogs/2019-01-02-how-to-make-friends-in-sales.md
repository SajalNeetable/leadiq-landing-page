title: How To Make Friends in Sales
---
The first 4 months on the sales floor, I would barely hit my quota, although, my effort told a different story 210 calls, 100 emails, and 100 voicemails. I began to question myself, my talent and skills, it got very existential. I would constantly annoy my training manager to do a one-on-one. I didn’t understand what I was doing incorrectly. Was it my tone? My pitch? My voice? Was I speaking too fast? Did I not come off as genuine?  I assumed my name wasn’t the issue, I had already changed that twice. I went from Rishi Mathur to Ricky Mather to Richard Matters.
