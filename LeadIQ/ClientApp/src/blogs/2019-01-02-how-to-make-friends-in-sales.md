title: The Importance of Friendship in Sales
description: >-
  In 2015 as a bright eyed, bushy tailed, young 25 year old, I embarked on a new
  journey for a company called Yext, a powerlistings company. Yext was a very
  tone down version of “Wolf of Wall Street”, just replace Jordan Belfort with
  Howard Lerman and quaaludes with Yoo-hoo and Asian Chex Mix. As Sales
  Associates, we were trained to smile and dial, like a bunch of robo-dialing
  zombies on nitrous oxide, expected to make 150 calls, 75 emails and 75-90
  voicemails per day.


  The obvious idea is spray and pray. The more people you pitch, the more sales
  you generate. It reminded me of my senior year of high school, the day before
  prom I was asking every girl if they would go with me in hopes one said yes.
  Unfortunately, the only person to say yes to me was my friend Omar and we went
  to go see Pirates of the Caribbean.

**Conundrum:**

The first 4 months on the sales floor, I would barely hit my quota, although, my effort told a different story 210 calls, 100 emails, and 100 voicemails. I began to question myself, my talent and skills, it got very existential. I would constantly annoy my training manager to do a one-on-one. I didn’t understand what I was doing incorrectly. Was it my tone? My pitch? My voice? Was I speaking too fast? Did I not come off as genuine?  I assumed my name wasn’t the issue, I had already changed that twice. I went from Rishi Mathur to Ricky Mather to Richard Matters.
