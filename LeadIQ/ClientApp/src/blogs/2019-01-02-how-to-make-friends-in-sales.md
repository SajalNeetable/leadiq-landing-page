title: The Importance of Friendship in Sales
description: >-
  In 2015 as a bright eyed, bushy tailed, young 25 year old, I embarked on a new
  journey for a company called Yext, a powerlistings company. Yext was a very
  tone down version of “Wolf of Wall Street”, just replace Jordan Belfort with
  Howard Lerman and quaaludes with Yoo-hoo and Asian Chex Mix. As Sales
  Associates, we were trained to smile and dial, like a bunch of robo-dialing
  zombies on nitrous oxide, expected to make 150 calls, 75 emails and 75-90
  voicemails per day.


  The obvious idea is spray and pray. The more people you pitch, the more sales
  you generate. It reminded me of my senior year of high school, the day before
  prom I was asking every girl if they would go with me in hopes one said yes.
  Unfortunately, the only person to say yes to me was my friend Omar and we went
  to go see Pirates of the Caribbean.

**Conundrum:**

The first 4 months on the sales floor, I would barely hit my quota, although, my effort told a different story 210 calls, 100 emails, and 100 voicemails. I began to question myself, my talent and skills, it got very existential. 

I would constantly annoy my training manager to do a one-on-one. I didn’t understand what I was doing incorrectly. Was it my tone? My pitch? My voice? Was I speaking too fast? Did I not come off as genuine?  I assumed my name wasn’t the issue, I had already changed that twice. I went from Rishi Mathur to Ricky Mather to Richard Matters.

Week after week with the same advice: “Your pitch is perfect, just slow down a bit more”. I felt trapped, in some type of weird,  glitchy matrix, where I relived the same moment over and over again like Bill Murray in Groundhog Day. 

**Inspiration:**

Something had to change, inspired by BBC’s Sherlock, I started to look through all my rejections to sense any type of pattern. I listened to each call and reviewed all email responses. I noticed that no matter how much I pitched to these individuals, they were not going to buy from me due to their lack of trust in me. Call after call I had the same objections: 


- “$45! Wow! I will need to speak to my partner before making such an extravagant investment.”  
- “I understand that I keep coming back to your site, but no I don’t need your companies help. I will do it myself and pay each of these search engines directly even if it costs more.” 
- “You seem like a great salesman, but this doesn’t seem to fit us right.” 
- “Where can I download the one year trial version” 
- “We don’t have the budget right now, maybe in two months.”
- “Can you send me a packet with more information…” *

* _Sidenote: This objection is the most annoying. What more do you want. I literally gave you everything, I even read case studies to help put you to sleep, but sure I’ll send you a packet with more information. _
