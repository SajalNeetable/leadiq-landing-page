### Step 1: [Download and Connect LeadIQ to Your Google Accounts](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/befngoippmpmobkkpkdoblkmofpjihnk)

_Wait a minute… isn’t that you guys?_

You know what reader? It is. We’re all about speed, workflow, and precision when it comes to making lead lists. That’s how Sonic would do it, that’s how we do it, and this is where it all starts. There are 50 credits waiting in your account as we speak. If it sucks, just uninstall it. We won’t even be mad, unlike this guy:

 Dr. Robotnik should have figured out how to strengthen the bottom of his ship by Level 3. Come on man.

**You’ll see this pop up if you don’t have it installed already:**

\*If you have a Salesforce account and want your verified leads to import into Salesforce, you’ll want to go to [the LeadIQ’s website](http://leadiq.com) and link up your Salesforce account.

Scroll to the button of the home screen, and login with Salesforce to connect up.

### Step 2: Hit the IQ Button Next To Your Address Bar

This will take you to Linkedin right away. The IQ Button is usually right near the address bar on Chrome. It should look something like this:

### Step 3: Hit the magnifying glass at the top of the LeadIQ app. Then type a job title you want to target for your lead list.

### Step 4: Capture Your Leads

You can add leads to your lead list one page at a time by pressing the + ALL button, or individually by just hitting the + Button next to each lead you want captured to your list.

### Step 5: View your list

You’re almost there. Now you just click the “VIEW” button inside LeadIQ, and you can look at your lead list in our web app, or Google Sheets.

It’s a thing of beauty, isn’t it? And it only took 3 minutes and 16 seconds to make.

Now go prospect! If you want to figure out how to get more credits, just hit the UPGRADE Button.

### Bonus: Sonic the Hedgehog Speed Run

Watch someone beat Sonic the Hedgehog in under 20 minutes.
