title: Selling Your Prospects on Their Dreams
---
If you sell ad tech, maybe you are helping a marketer hit their revenue goals. If you sell to IT, maybe you are speeding up a customer’s website and decreasing their website outages. If it’s HR, you may help them build the dream team!

With the Magician archetype, you sell on someone’s dreams and imagination, and help make them a reality. There should be some mystery to your online brand if you do this, but also good experiences for those that interact with you. 

Pushing the big picture is more focused on selling the individual’s motivation with your buyer. You buyer may want to own a house someday, or start a family. Magicians make it seem possible, and every buyer wants to do something magical too!


The easiest brand archetype example that everyone brings up for this, and one of the most valuable brands in the world is the Walt Disney Company.

Every part of Disney’s company DNA is built on being a magician brand, and providing a magical experience for their customers. If you call their customer support, they’ll tell you to have a magical time.

Whether it’s making movies about princesses, theme parks, or owning entire fictional universes like Marvel and Star Wars, Disney is constantly finding ways to innovate and flex our imaginations. The brand equity has obviously payed massive dividends.

One example of Disney executing from a business standpoint on their brand archetype was buying Marvel for $4 billion dollars in 2009.  Since then, they've generated  $14 billion in revenue from their in 18 movies (Iron Man was pre-acquisition).

Disney's brand helps viewers escape, and helps them live out their imaginations. There is a reason children don’t defend Ice Age or Shrek the same way they do Toy Story and Frozen. It’s all about the belief in dreams coming true. 

There are a number of people out there that sell people on their dreams. They focus on inspiring people this way with the content they push. One person that a lot sales folks follow and resonate with that is this archetype is Tony Robbins.

Robbins has built almost a cult like following of loyal customers and fans,. One of the ways he’s been able to do this is by producing and running seminars that focus heavily on trying to get people to be understand their motivations. Those motivations lead to people achieving their goals. 

Robbins has carefully crafted his content around possibility. You can actually see it in his social posts too.

_If you are selling to your prospects as a magician, you have to figure out how to tell them based on their dreams and aspirations_

Being a magician brand can also be fun if you try to create cool experiences for your prospects and customers. Maybe you invite prospects out to go to lightshow, or maybe you surprise at their office with their favorite food. 

It’s not only big dreams and goals but giving experiences that make customers imaginations come true as well. 

One example that always comes to mind is a campaign WestJet Airlines did a few years back. 

WestJet went and asked friends and family of passengers on a flight what they wanted for Christmas. When passengers landed at their destinations, they had gifts delivered to all of them on the baggage claim carousel.

If you want to go above and beyond for your customers, and talk about these experiences and beliefs in your sales content, this a good archetype for you.
