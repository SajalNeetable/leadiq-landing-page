Life As A Salesman:

Selling is an art, it’s not necessarily about the product, it’s about the trust you build. Doesn’t matter if you’re selling shoes to a Cutco sales rep or Lollipops to a nun, we live in an era where any solution you provide there are at least a hundred similar. 

Back in 2015, I worked for a tech company and every day for two straight weeks, I remember banging my head on my desk. At the end of each work day, I would see my name at the bottom of the sales leader board highlighted in red. It was the type of red that created internal panic, that type of color that caused you to accidentally do the harlem shake when you saw it.
