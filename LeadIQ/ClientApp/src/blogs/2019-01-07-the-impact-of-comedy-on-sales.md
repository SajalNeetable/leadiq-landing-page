Life As A Salesman:

Selling is an art, it’s not necessarily about the product, it’s about the trust you build. Doesn’t matter if you’re selling shoes to a Cutco sales rep or Lollipops to a nun, we live in an era where any solution you provide there are at least a hundred similar. 

Back in 2015, I worked for a tech company and every day for two straight weeks, I remember banging my head on my desk. At the end of each work day, I would see my name at the bottom of the sales leader board highlighted in red. It was the type of red that created internal panic, that type of color that caused you to accidentally do the harlem shake when you saw it.

Each color had a significance, it felt as if they all had some type of individual achievement attached:

Color
Meaning
Achievement Felt
Flashing Colors
4 or more sales
Cloud nine. You felt as if you were one the best salesman.
Blue
1 to 3 sales
Safe. You felt as if a huge weight has been lifted off your shoulders.
Red
No Sales
Judgement. You felt as if all eyes were on you for being the worst salesman ever, “You call yourself a salesman. Why do they even let you on the phone?”

To this day the color red triggers me the same way all words trigger the politically correct, “hey you can’t say bald, it discriminates those without hair!”  

I feel like a war veteran constantly having flashbacks anytime a car backfires. Similarly, every time I see the color red, I have the urge to start cold calling. For weeks I would go home feeling anxious and stressed as the sense of job security started to slowly fade away. 

I tried everything I could to increase my sales. For example:
- I would meet with all the top sales reps and shadow them
- I would reach out to top sales reps on LinkedIn and bombard them with questions
- I would study my game tapes (recording from sales calls) and look over the playbook (sales script) constantly. 

After all this work, I was still in the red. It was a glaring sign of complete failure.
