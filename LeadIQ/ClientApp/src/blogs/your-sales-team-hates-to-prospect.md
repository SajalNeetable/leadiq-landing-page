title: Your Sales Team Hates To Prospect? Who Cares
description: Aaron Ross has no clothes. If you do not know who Aaron Ross is, he is the author of the tech sales “bible” Predictable Revenue, which validates lazy salespeople everywhere by stating they shouldn’t be prospecting. His argument more or less claims that it’s a waste of their time, not very effective and someone cheaper can do it.

### Let me explain why Aaron is wrong and why you, as a sales leader, should care.

s with all pied pipers in history, Ross’s siren song is comically simple and dangerously seductive, especially for the salespeople.“Of course _I shouldn’t be cold calling!_,” they swoon. _“I am a highly paid, experienced professional! I am a CLOSER!”_

Oh how they cooed as an entire sales automation industry arose to support their ruse. Send more emails faster! Let the Sales Development Reps (aka entry level full-time prospectors) man the phones so the account executives can… well I’m not sure what else they are doing. They certainly aren’t building proposals 12 hours a day.

I have a long-standing bet – any sales leader who can show me 3 consecutive weeks of verifiable calendars for at least 5 of their reps representing at least 80% of their sales team with an average of 10 hours per day of booked-solid meetings with different external prospects like this guy:

I will buy them a steak dinner at the finest restaurant in town.

The fact is most sales reps are WOEFULLY under-worked much to everyone’s detriment. AND I have yet to find a business of any scale complaining of having TOO MANY qualified leads. So where does that leave us?

**Smile and dial, baby! (Yes, even you, “Mr. Closer.”)**

Much like Andersen’s [“elegantly dressed” emperor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emperor%27s_New_Clothes), Aaron’s [mishegas](http://www.yourdictionary.com/mishegoss) must be laid bare. Let’s start by looking at his objections to salespeople prospecting one at a time. I’m convinced that I am one of a dozen people in the world who has taken the time to REALLY understand his argument as opposed to just nodding in agreement or dismissing it out of hand. Of course I have no proof of this, but the fact that there has been so little commentary surrounding this seems supports my point just fine.

Venture capitalist David Skok wrote a blog post a few years back following an interview with Aaron about his method. He outlined with bullet points as to why salespeople should not prospect. Below, I’ve taken them verbatim from the post, with my commentary under each one:

**1\. “Lack of Motivation: Experienced sales people hate to prospect, and are usually terrible at it.”**

Hating to do something doesn’t mean you shouldn’t do it. Sometimes I hate to exercise. Doesn’t make it less important. Being bad at something is another matter. Part of it is leadership, and that’s on you as a sales manager to hire the right people and provide better training. But being bad at something is usually the result of a vicious feedback loop – you can’t do something well, so you hate it, which in turn keeps you from getting better at it (or even trying), reinforcing the whole thing. This argument falls apart in the face of better expectations, candidate selection and training. Pure and simple.

“Let the Sales Development Reps man the phones so the account executives can… well I’m not sure what else they are doing. They certainly aren’t building proposals 12 hours a day.”

**2\. “Lack of Focus: Even if a salesperson does do some prospecting successfully, as soon as they generate some pipeline, they become too busy to prospect. It’s not sustainable. Any individual that tries to juggle too many responsibilities, will have a much lower ability to get things done.”**

Completely false. Demonstrably false in fact. What do you think the highest performing people in the world do? Movie producers, big-time investment bankers, titans of industry. I’ll give you a hint – they aren’t in the back office fiddling with the fonts on their Powerpoints. They are in the field, pressing flesh, raising money, getting their latest projects out there. Kissing frogs. In other words, PROSPECTING!

What do you think those guys on [Shark Tank](http://abc.go.com/shows/shark-tank) are doing? They call it deal flow but that’s just a fancy term for prospecting. Truth: all the pros do ALL DAY is prospect. Yet somehow they find time to close deals. So ask yourself – who do you want for a rep? A pro… or a piker? As the architect of an organization, what do you want? A group of order takers, recipients of leads drummed up by the SDRs, hard workers to be sure but by your own design the lowest paid people on the floor? Or do you want a team of true “Grade A” players? The choice is yours. (More on this in a moment)

**3\. “Sales people have a reputation for being ADD – how does adding more responsibilities help that? For example, qualifying web leads is a much lower value distraction for sales people than managing current clients. And managing a large current client base is a distraction from closing new clients!”**

Again, it’s on you to hire better ones. They exist and are not exceedingly rare. They might not be tremendously abundant, but nothing valuable ever is. Ross never explains why it’s OK to have an rep who is ADD work with a prospect to close a deal over them finding it in the first place. To me, the former sounds more risky than the latter.

**4\. “Lack of proper training and support: Their company doesn’t train them on how to prospect effectively, give them helpful tools or reasonable goals. Usually the guidance is along the lines of “make more calls!” Wow, that’s helpful.”**

This one is on you. I have [my own recommendations](http://frontlineselling.com/) but there are others. Either way, if you think prospecting simply = “more calls,” you probably shouldn’t be a sales manager. Still I suspect this is a straw man anyway: any sales leader worth his salt knows it’s not that reductive.

**5\. “Unclear Metrics: It’s harder to break out and keep track of key metrics (inbound leads, qualification and conversion rates, customer success rates…) if all the functions are lumped into single areas. Different roles makes it much easier to break out different steps in your processes, which means better metrics.”**

I agree it can make it harder, but not excessively difficult. Excel, anyone? Plus, hard does not mean unnecessary. And, I repeat, hard does not mean not worthwhile. If anything, the opposite is true. As I’ve said before, if it were easy, it wouldn’t be valuable.

**6\. “Less Visibility Into Problems: When things aren’t working, lumped responsibilities obscure what’s happening and make it more difficult to isolate and fix issues with accountable follow through.”**

Once again, this is on you. If you can’t walk and chew gum at the same time, I can’t help you with that either. Trust me when I say people can and do effectively juggle these issues.

Now that we’ve discussed why salespeople should not be DISMISSED from prospecting, let’s consider why they should DO it:

As sales manager your job is to make the most of the resources that you have available to you, and that’s essentially people. For yourself, for the org and most importantly for your employees, your duty is to help them be all they can be. That means shorter sales cycles and more deals per head. It also means as many deals as possible before adding costs, i.e. another head. Which means fully utilizing your reps.

First, let’s look at their time. [Almost half of all reps don’t hit quota](http://pleinairestrategies.com/2016/01/whats-the-number-one-reason-salespeople-miss-quota/). Is that really marketing’s fault for not supplying enough inbound leads? That’s a big chunk of the workforce to excuse from prospecting. Ask yourself: what duty do you have to them in forwarding their career? If they are missing quota, you are setting them up for failure in this job AND the next, and you can’t let that happen without a fight. If they are hitting quota, ask: why aren’t they exceeding it? Your comp plan should have accelerators that incentivize over-performance. You want your reps pushing so hard [they run THROUGH the endzone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_hMgQ_rrtk), not stop the minute they cross the goalline. They will thank you for it.

This brings me to my next point – **a prospecting rep is a better rep**.Our numbers show deals sourced by reps close at 2x the rate of those sourced by SDRs. Which makes sense, as the rep is establishing a relationship with the prospect from the get-go. Unlike with the SDR model, [there is no “hand off’](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-i-really-dont-like-sdrae-model-loren-padelford) – everything moves faster and feels more personal, because it is!

A prospecting salesperson is by definition a proactive salesperson. They do not wait for deals because they cannot. They never whine about “more leads” because if they have time to lodge that complaint, they know what they have to do to rectify it. Similarly, they lean into the sale.

In an age where [sales professionals are being disintermediated through an online shopping cart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFbswKm6vRI), can salespeople really afford to take the easy way out? A commission is earned, it is not given. If the rep isn’t adding value to the equation, or if they aren’t proactive IN EVERY STAGE OF THE SALES CYCLE – [sourcing leads](http://leadiq.com/), sourcing deals, sourcing solutions for the prospect; it’s all the same – they are on the road to being replaced.

It is true that prospecting and selling are separate skills– another excuse championed by the Sales 2.0 crowd. However, they are not unrelated and are both required. Dribbling is not the same as shooting. Passing is not the same as dunking. But you can’t really compete without mastering them all.
