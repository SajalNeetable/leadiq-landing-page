title: How to Get Prospects to Accept Your LinkedIn Connection Requests
description: Remember when adding strangers on LinkedIn was frowned upon? If we flashback to just a couple of years ago, LinkedIn used to require you disclose why you are adding someone on LinkedIn. Today, with Sales Navigator becoming the standard way people research their prospects, LinkedIn doesn’t ask you how you know a connection when you make a request

Since the culture on LinkedIn has changed significantly over the past couple of years, I thought it’d be a good idea today give some updated tips on how to get someone to accept your connection request on LinkedIn.

### Tip # 1: Always include a personal note.

This one is obvious, so I’m not going to go too deep into it here since most of this post references this. Let’s just say it like this; if you aren’t adding a personal note to your connection request, you are either being lazy, or you may be ignorant of this amazing feature. For the sake of this tip, let’s look at the LinkedIn connection requests I received over the weekend, that I don’t plan on adding to my network.This is what your prospects are seeing:

If you take a look the connection requests I received, tons have no personal message. One person left the default LinkedIn personal note in there, wasting the real estate to make a solid first impression with me.

If you don’t have a personal note in there, the only things someone is going to judge you on is your title, headshot, and company. With no personal message and a sales related title, it might as well be a death sentence for your connection request. Notice how much the generic message above pops? Put in a nice little customized message there, and you’ll pop too!,

### So how do you do a personalized note with your LinkedIn connection request?

**This gif will show you how easy it is. Check it out:**

If you are using LinkedIn Sales Navigator, the personal message option is included right in the connection request pop up.

### One quick warning!

FYI if you are adding a connection from the “People You May Know” area on LinkedIn via your mobile device, you won’t get the opportunity to add a personalized note when you hit Connect so just be careful on their mobile app. I assume LinkedIn will fix this soon.

### Tip #2: Personalize your personal note.

Depending on what version of LinkedIn you are running, there is a reason LinkedIn calls it a “personal note” or “personal message.” Now that we told you to use this feature, let’s talk about the core part..actually personalizing it.

There are all kinds of ways that you can personalize a LinkedIn message. Do you have a trigger that made you reach out? Don’t be afraid to remove the forth wall, and just tell them how you discovered them.

Maybe you saw they commented on a certain post of someone you know, or shared a mutual connection’s post. Did they do something different or unique that is in the public eye?

I did video on triggers a few months back.These triggers can also apply to your LinkedIn connections:

The trigger and your message need to be customized and mostly about your prospect. If you do this, you’ll get more accepts.

I don’t recommend asking for a meeting in the connection request. Your goal with connection request is to get accepted, not to book a meeting. Which brings us to our next tip.

### Tip #3: Don’t pitch in your connection request

Over the weekend, I got this personal note with a connection request:

![See-less](/img/See-less.png)

This message (this person does not work at Hubspot FYI) started out great with the personalization about technology (we don’t use Hubspot by the way but it’s ok), but it turned into a boilerplate pitch.

You want to make your message mostly about your prospect. I don’t care that this company is aggressively building their portfolio of companies. That’s like telling me… “Hey, we really want your money.”

Instead, he could have mentioned something about the content I put up, my videos, or just that he wanted to personally get to know someone at LeadIQ because he thinks we’re doing some cool stuff to help prospectors.

The other thing about this message is that it talked about cutting a deal. I’ve accidentally done this before, but never want to lead with price. Mentioning the deal upfront creates a tendency for prospects to think about budget when no value has been presented. You always want to wait for pricing discussions until you’ve shown some value. If your company’s competitive advantage is pricing, you need to show the value before bringing it up.

Either way, from a first impression stand point, the message needs to focus on your prospect.

### Tip #4: Combo your connection requests with another channel.

I get lots of cold calls on my cell everyday. I subscribe to the concept that you should leave a voicemail, especially now that I’m on the buyer side. I simply don’t answer phone numbers if I don’t recognize them. Leaving a voicemail helps me put a name to the number.

With that being said, one of my favorite ways to use connection requests is as one touch point, while syncing it to another. Check out this wonderful use of the one-two punch combo from talented Business Development guy at Blue Ridge Development, [Alan Wetzel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alan-wetzel-56479940/)

Alan added me on LinkedIn with a personalized message on Sunday mentioning he was going to call me. He didn’t pitch me on the LinkedIn connection. He mentioned that had seen my profile come up a lot. After adding me, he left this voicemail on Monday:

**He immediately followed it with this direct message:**

![Alan-Wetzel](/img/Alan-Wetzel.png)

Alan definitely got a reply from me. Stacking more than one channel is the right way to use LinkedIn. If you planning on doing an activity, tell the prospect what’s coming. One other thing I enjoyed about Alan’s voicemail is he entertained me by talking about my picture. You can bring something as simple as that to brighten someone’s day.

### Tip #5: Make your connection requests human and entertaining.

People want to have fun. No matter where you work, we all want to escape for a couple of minutes. If you don’t work in sales, you may be checking out LinkedIn to escape out of the grind of the job for a couple of minutes.

Find some way to have fun with your prospects on your connection requests. I remember one of our SDRs once noticed that a prospect took their headshot in front of a beautiful fountain. When he said it though, the water in the background made the prospect almost look like they were white water rafting.

The SDR told the prospect in the connection request that they must be the calmest white water rafter ever, and he ended up booking the meeting. The prospect had a good laugh, the rest was history.

Entertaining your prospect could be the missing key to getting good response rates on connection requests.

If you follow these tips, you should see an increase in your replies and opportunities. Just remember, not every industry frequently checks LinkedIn, so don’t be too aggressive on there if your prospects don’t check their account too often. Look at their activity history and see how often they participate online to get a feel for it.
