title: How Sales Automation Is Changing Sales
---
Sales Automation is all the rave nowadays.

Over the past decade, we’ve seen a massive shift towards inside sales in the B2B world. Teams are leaning more and more on prospecting to build up their revenue. As a result, an entire sales software space has opened up, with hundreds of tools that will help sales teams sell faster. Per [Venture Beat](https://venturebeat.com/2015/12/01/317-companies-10b-in-funding-and-110k-employees-inside-sales-startups-exploding/) as of 2017, there are now at least 5–6 different options in every part of a team’s sales stack.

Sales tools are making it easier for salespeople to send more emails, make more phone calls, and touch thousands of accounts per week. With the sales process optimized, there should be no issues for sales teams to hit their quotas, crush their goals, and help their company to achieve their revenue milestones.

## Yet …60% of salespeople won’t hit their quota this month. It’s no secret. Most people don’t like being “touched” by a salesperson.

### Sales has a bad name.

It’s hard to deny that salespeople conjure up a bad image in most people’s mind. There is a stereotype of salespeople being pushy, calling you, and sending never-ending emails about how their services would be tantamount to you or your organization’s success. All it took was a few bad sales people to make this happen (dishonest, lazy, inattentive, or selfish).
