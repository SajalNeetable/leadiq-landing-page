I don’t claim that we have a perfect system but I am fortunate to work with extremely talented individuals and, hopefully, you’ll find our process useful. Another thing to keep in mind is that we are a start up, so the tactics might not be right for your business but hope you find value in the strategic aspects outlined below if you’re a part of a larger org. **Here’s how we do it.**

### Start early or start late but do it!

Start ups are notorious for cutting corners and doing only what’s necessary. While I love that culture, it’s also important not to miss this early foundational step and if you have – correct that quickly.

Aligning marketing and sales could be the difference between exceptional and average performance of your startup as it scales. Ask your marketing team if they’re aligning themselves towards lead quantity or quality. Does lead quality mean the same thing for both sales and marketing teams? Is there a standard and agreement between both orgs?

### SQLs

The foundation of the agreement between the teams is defining the sales qualified lead (SQL). Ideally sales would only talk to someone who is ready to buy. That, of course, is a pipe dream. At the same time though, their time is valuable and talking to prospects who are not a fit is both wasteful and discouraging. Both teams need to agree on a compromise and a guess of what the best sales qualified lead at scale looks like.

### Commitments

Once the formula is identified, sales needs to commit to specific SLAs on those leads and put their best foot forward. How quickly does the sales team follow up on leads provided? How do they prioritize the leads and balance the workload with other deals they’re working on?

Keep in mind that while the SQL standard might change the only way to truly test is to assume you got it right and give it your best effort. Then and only then you can iterate and eventually find the right balance.

### **Measure** and **automate**

As you’re testing, make sure you have a concrete outcome you’re trying to measure against. That outcome should be directly tied to the success of your business. Track leads generated through the whole process and automate as much as possible. Implement tools & processes to make sure you can quickly get snapshots of data that can help you identify any bottlenecks and make adjustments. For AdStage, in this example, that would be identifying how many leads for different segments (outbound vs sales dev. vs inbound vs free trials) resulted in scheduled demos, demos attended, opportunities created and deals closed. Then layering average revenue per user (ARPU) & lifetime value (LTV) on top of this data.

### **Feedback** mechanism

Make sure that you have a few feedback mechanisms set up between marketing and sales. You should have a general alignment meeting set up on a monthly basis. Make sure the meeting has a concrete agenda and both teams come prepared. Review progress made so far and any to do items from the last meeting, analyze data from snapshots (as per above), make sure both teams keep each other in check as to the promises made, provide ground for feedback and, finally, identify next steps
