title: A Training Exercise To Make Your Reps Sound More Human
description: >-
  I run the sales development team over here at LeadForensics. As those of you
  that are in sales development know, it's a grinding, taxing industry to be in.
  The day to day gets very repetitive, so I'm constantly looking for ways to
  keep things interesting, right? And to do trainings in a unique way that still
  delivers value to the reps, but gets them out of their normal comfort zone and
  breaks up some of the monotony.
