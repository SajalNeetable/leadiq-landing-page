title: A Training Exercise To Make Your Reps Sound More Human
description: >-
  I run the sales development team over here at LeadForensics. As those of you
  that are in sales development know, it's a grinding, taxing industry to be in.
  The day to day gets very repetitive, so I'm constantly looking for ways to
  keep things interesting, right? And to do trainings in a unique way that still
  delivers value to the reps, but gets them out of their normal comfort zone and
  breaks up some of the monotony.

So, I was scrolling on Linkedin the other day and saw a video of two dudes dressed in ridiculous suits. One being Ryan O'Hara the VP of Marketing & Growth at Lead IQ. They talked about humanizing yourself in your email outreach, right? Humanizing your messaging beyond the standard emails everybody gets in their inbox every day.

At Lead Forensics, we are much more focused on an old school approach. We do a lot of phone outreach. We don't mess around with email or LinkedIn that much. So, I wanted to take the messaging, excuse me, the training that he talked about which was essentially, stepping away from your normal scripting process and writing a message in the voice of your favorite characters, whether that be from a book, TV show, or movie or podcast, whatever. And take an afternoon writing the way they may write an email to your potential buyers and see what kind of freedom that allows you essentially, right?


So, I took that idea and brought it to what we typically call an Objection Handling training, where we will talk about the objections we get most frequently...and just have...we typically work about how to answer them in the most business-appropriate ways possible. What this allowed us to do is take a step out of the normal way of communicating with potential prospects, right? Get away from business appropriate responses because some of the stuff did get rated R for [inaudible 00:02:17] better way to put it. [inaudible 00:02:19] freedom and personality into the messaging, right? We had characters like Tony Stark, Annalise Keating, who's from a show I've literally never seen on TV. I guess some [inaudible 00:02:29] has that name. Don Draper, Ricky from the Trailer Park Boys, some really interesting character choices.


I had the group pick an objection that had been getting to them a lot recently, which was an objection that was a competitor essentially, right? So I told them to spend about fifteen minutes writing down the characteristics that defined the particular character they decided to be. What makes Don Draper, Don Draper? What makes Ricky, Ricky? How do they handle problems? Why are they unique? Why are they recognizable as a character.


Once they identified what that character was and who they were, I had them literally go about role playing the situation where they...I told them to imagine...Tony Stark had lost all his money in some sort of Ponzi scheme or something and he had to go out and get a job and we hired him on as an SDR in Lead Forensics. That Annalise Keating, I guess she's a lawyer, her practice got sued for malpractice and she had to leave the political realm. So we hired these people, right? I wanted them to pretend like they had gotten this objection on the phone as that person; had them role play it back and forth. I tell ya, it was hysterical to watch. It literally was. I let them get the freedom...I didn't tell them to impersonate the person, per se, but a lot of them did, with accents and everything.
