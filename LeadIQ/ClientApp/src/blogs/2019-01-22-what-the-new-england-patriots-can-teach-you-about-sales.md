title: What the New England Patriots Can Teach You About Sales

## Lesson 1: One vision will always beat out two visions.

For people that don’t know this, one of the things that makes the Brady-Belichick era of the Patriots so unique is that Belichick has a final say on the roster.

Most NFL teams have a General Manager who decides who makes the roster, and then the Head Coach will decide how to use the talent the GM has supplied on the roster throughout the season. 

The Patriot Way is wrapped around only one vision. Whether you are a CRO, CMO, VP of Sales or a VP of Marketing, one vision will always beat out two or three different visions. 

In the case of the Patriots, the framework is wrapped around the concept that not one player is bigger than the team. Belichick has this philosophy ingrained on the way the roster is built, all the way to the way they execute plays on Sunday. It isn’t one architecture either. In the early days of the Patriots dynasty, they built their team on a strong defense. As the years have gone on, they’ve pivoted from that to a strong offense and conservative defense. As Brady has aged,  they are now building the team to be more adaptive to their surroundings. 

Whether it’s marketing picking an event to sponsor, or a sales rep trying to post content on Linkedin, all revenue at a company should fall under one vision. What is your brand and your sales team going to be known for?

One vision always wins out. At LeadIQ, we’re really trying to drive our vision around the idea that every rep should feel good about their job, whether they work at a big company or a small company.
