title: What the New England Patriots Can Teach You About Sales
description: >-
  Two weeks back the New England Patriots thumped the Los Angeles Chargers.  You
  have to live under a rock to not know how successful they’ve been. Let’s put
  it this way…

  Kansas Chiefs Quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who is the leading candidate to win
  the MVP in the NFL this year, couldn’t get driver’s license the last time the
  Patriots weren’t in the AFC Championship game.

  My brother Jack O’Hara, who was born in 1999, has no memory of the Patriots
  missing the playoffs, except the year they went 11-5 with Matt Cassel due to
  Tom Brady tearing his ACL in 2008.

  I’m sure there are tons of motivation speakers out there that could talk about
  about having a winners mentality, and how driving in private jets to their
  next million dollar deal is awesome.

  I’m not going to do that today. As a lifelong Patriots fan, who also remembers
  the Ben Coats, Terry Glenn, Shaun Jefferson, Bill Parcels to Pete Carroll era
  of the team, I know I’m spoiled.  I’ll tell you some things managers can learn
  from the Patriots success.

  (Note: This blog post was written prior to the Patriots clinching a trip to
  their 3rd consecutive Super Bowl).

## Lesson 1: One vision will always beat out two visions.

For people that don’t know this, one of the things that makes the Brady-Belichick era of the Patriots so unique is that Belichick has a final say on the roster.

Most NFL teams have a General Manager who decides who makes the roster, and then the Head Coach will decide how to use the talent the GM has supplied on the roster throughout the season. 

The Patriot Way is wrapped around only one vision. Whether you are a CRO, CMO, VP of Sales or a VP of Marketing, one vision will always beat out two or three different visions. 

In the case of the Patriots, the framework is wrapped around the concept that not one player is bigger than the team. Belichick has this philosophy ingrained on the way the roster is built, all the way to the way they execute plays on Sunday. It isn’t one architecture either. In the early days of the Patriots dynasty, they built their team on a strong defense. As the years have gone on, they’ve pivoted from that to a strong offense and conservative defense. As Brady has aged,  they are now building the team to be more adaptive to their surroundings. 

Whether it’s marketing picking an event to sponsor, or a sales rep trying to post content on Linkedin, all revenue at a company should fall under one vision. What is your brand and your sales team going to be known for?

One vision always wins out. At LeadIQ, we’re really trying to drive our vision around the idea that every rep should feel good about their job, whether they work at a big company or a small company.
