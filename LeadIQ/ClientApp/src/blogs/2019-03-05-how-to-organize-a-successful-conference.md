title: How To Organize A Successful Event
---
As the winter slowly fades away… and by that I mean slowly creeping into our spring and chipping at our sanity. 

Good news arrives, conferences season is here. Understandably conferences happen all year, but from March to June is a very popular time for most conferences. 

For example the ten largest sales conferences take place during this period. 

- AA-ISP Digital Sales World 2019 
- Rainmaker
- Sandler Sales and Leadership Summit
- TOPO Sales Summit
- Pulse
- SiriusDecisions Sales Leadership Exchange
- Unleash 2019
- Hypergrowth
- LeadsCon
- Accelerate

Side note: I understand that spring really doesn’t take effect till mid-march, but how many times can you claim your car has been frozen in the beginning of March? C’MON!

But this needs to be emphasized, understanding your audience is massively important.  A lot of times conferences tend to forget that point. 

They just haphazardly throw together an event. I know we make jokes at the expense of Billy McFarland and the Fyre Festival disaster, but there are many conferences that are just as disorganized as that festival.  

I once attended an event for Global Warming in New Jersey, the one aspect they nailed was the concept of reducing our footprint. That theme was amazing, but as I entered the event everyone was just trying to sell me a product. Even the keynote speakers weren’t really addressing an issue, they were mostly promoting their products. 

Which brings me to my next point:
