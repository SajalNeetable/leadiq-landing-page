title: The Importance of Hiring Your First SDR
---
“So every 100 emails, I should get 5 responses?” 

Up until joining LeadIQ, being an SDR made no sense to me. Like the WNBA or my fear of shark attacks in a swimming pool. 

Being an SDR seemed to me as a stepping stone to becoming an Account Executive. Almost every company I interviewed with described SDRs as a pawn in some kind of chess match. 

Someone who works tirelessly to try and vet potential clients just to get them to book a demo with an Account Executive (AE). With a tired out script and a cheerful attitude this endeavor seemed almost laughable. 

Once I joined LeadIQ, I realized there is something actually fun and interesting about being an SDR. Something actually almost poetic about the job. See, I realized if you redefine how you approach your outreach this position can become very entertaining. 

Instead of acting like a mindless zombie everyday, you transform, like an animorph, into someone more creative. Someone who figured out ways to stand out from the crowd and showcases his personality with each touch. 

This realization got me to think about how important is it to hire the right SDR to your team and how teams should act when hiring SDRs to become more successful. 

So I ventured out to interview with VP of Sales, Sales Managers, and CEOs from some of the best sales teams to understand best practices when hiring SDRs. 

## Setting The Culture:

Majority of my conversations have ended with the notion that your first sales rep is really helping to set the stepping stones for your sales culture. 

They are basically defining how your future sales reps will outreach, they are helping create the playbook for the company. 

These first hires are crucial in a startup because in a startup environment there is so much accountability. Most of the time you aren’t given leads to follow-up with. You need to have a hunter-like mentality. Basically, find and source leads yourself.
