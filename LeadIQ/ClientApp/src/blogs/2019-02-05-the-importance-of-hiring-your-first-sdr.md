title: The Importance of Hiring Your First SDR
---
“So every 100 emails, I should get 5 responses?” 

Up until joining LeadIQ, being an SDR made no sense to me. Like the WNBA or my fear of shark attacks in a swimming pool. 

Being an SDR seemed to me as a stepping stone to becoming an Account Executive. Almost every company I interviewed with described SDRs as a pawn in some kind of chess match. 

Someone who works tirelessly to try and vet potential clients just to get them to book a demo with an Account Executive (AE). With a tired out script and a cheerful attitude this endeavor seemed almost laughable. 

Once I joined LeadIQ, I realized there is something actually fun and interesting about being an SDR. Something actually almost poetic about the job. See, I realized if you redefine how you approach your outreach this position can become very entertaining. 

Instead of acting like a mindless zombie everyday, you transform, like an animorph, into someone more creative. Someone who figured out ways to stand out from the crowd and showcases his personality with each touch. 

This realization got me to think about how important is it to hire the right SDR to your team and how teams should act when hiring SDRs to become more successful. 

So I ventured out to interview with VP of Sales, Sales Managers, and CEOs from some of the best sales teams to understand best practices when hiring SDRs. 

## Setting The Culture:

Majority of my conversations have ended with the notion that your first sales rep is really helping to set the stepping stones for your sales culture. 

They are basically defining how your future sales reps will outreach, they are helping create the playbook for the company. 

These first hires are crucial in a startup because in a startup environment there is so much accountability. Most of the time you aren’t given leads to follow-up with. You need to have a hunter-like mentality. Basically, find and source leads yourself.

## Create an Environment of Success:

When you hire your first SDR/BDR make sure you clearly vet the candidate and create an environment for success. 

Most organizations tend to find people with proven track records without really understanding how that specific individual operates. 

For example, when Jack Kosakowski was hiring his first BDR, like everybody, he thought he “...brought on the perfect guy…” Shortly after Jack found out his mistake, he hired someone who was not the right fit for the job at all. On paper he was great, but Jack found out that this SDR was not a hunter. He was just a sales rep with a proven track record.

Jack realized he brought him on too early. He was not set up to create an environment for this BDR to succeed. He didn’t have the infrastructure, “...don’t have the right engine for them, especially if they are not a hunter. They are not use to that”  So he had to go back and find someone who had those specific qualities. 

## Setting Expectations:

Being an SDR/BDR is a very tough role, there are a lot of rejections they to face on a day to day basis. 

So make sure you provide them with a set of expectations before you hire, for example: 
Make sure they align with company values. 
Have strong internal intrinsic motivators for being part of the SDR team.
Alignment with company values.
Fearless: Not afraid of change and providing feedback.

Setting these expectations up front will really help in the interview process. You can understand who really wants to grow and learn within the SDR/BDR role itself, not using the opportunity as a stepping stone to become an Account Executive. 

## Face Of The Company::

A great question to ask yourself during the hiring process is: can this SDR hire represent your organization?

## Ability To Adapt:

The ability to think quick on your feet is truly something I feel a lot of SDRs are missing. 

Very much like comedy a lot of SDRs stick to a script, they don’t deter and don’t take into account the potential client. I call this the Seinfeld approach, except Seinfeld is way funnier than you are.  

With this approach what happens is when SDRs are given an objection they aren’t familiar with, they do not know how to think for themselves and they wind up like a deer in headlights. 

Being able to adapt and change for any situation that arises is key, this deals with your mindset. The key is you need a good blend of discipline and flexibility. 

When thinking of SDRs, typically they’ll be early in their career and easily influenced. You need someone who’s going to not be sidetracked by an AE, but also works well with their direct manager.
