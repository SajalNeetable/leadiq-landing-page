title: The Importance of Hiring Your First SDR
---
“So every 100 emails, I should get 5 responses?” 

Up until joining LeadIQ, being an SDR made no sense to me. Like the WNBA or my fear of shark attacks in a swimming pool. 

Being an SDR seemed to me as a stepping stone to becoming an Account Executive. Almost every company I interviewed with described SDRs as a pawn in some kind of chess match. 

Someone who works tirelessly to try and vet potential clients just to get them to book a demo with an Account Executive (AE). With a tired out script and a cheerful attitude this endeavor seemed almost laughable. 

Once I joined LeadIQ, I realized there is something actually fun and interesting about being an SDR. Something actually almost poetic about the job. See, I realized if you redefine how you approach your outreach this position can become very entertaining.
