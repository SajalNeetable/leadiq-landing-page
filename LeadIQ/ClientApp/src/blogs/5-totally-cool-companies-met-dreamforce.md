description: Confession time. We love meeting people. I work remotely for LeadIQ from my home in New Hampshire, so when LeadIQ took me out of my shackles, and let me walk the floor of Dreamforce last week, I was super jacked up !

Here are some cool people we met with in no particular order.

### 1\. [Conversica](https://www.conversica.com/)

These guys are bad ass. If your sales team’s leads are a broken juke box, these guys are the Fonz. All it takes is one punch, and the music starts.

They allow you to use an AI to automate a ton of sales stuff. They’ll make your opportunities more qualified by allowing you to build a machine Sales Assistant to do some of the dirty work before you talk to a customer.

Besides, our sales rep Cole talked with some of their team, and he thinks they rock.

**Cole what do you think?**

### 2\. [Demandbase](https://www.demandbase.com/)

If you want to class up your sales team, Demandbase is where to go. They actually invited us to a dinner party, and it was so classy it made Billy Zane’s character from Titanic seem trashy. Que the String Quartet (yes this awesome)!

DemandBase is all about Account Based Marketing…and help sales teams filter through the best leads, and focus your company’s time and effort on the right decision makers. You can even advertise just to the accounts your team is targeting.

**Cole, what do you think?**

### 3\. [Cirrus Insight](https://www.cirrusinsight.com/)

Do you hate having to bounce between a million tabs, and keep a bunch of Salesforce stuff open? We do too. This is what happens to us every time we get a lead email us back, and we have to manually put it back into Salesforce:

Cirrus makes it really easy for sales teams to get emails in and out of Salesforce right from your inbox, without having to turn into a murderous green rage monster. Cirrus has hundreds of thousands of users leveraging their tech to make inboxes talk to Salesforce.

They are also launching an email tool that will allow you to add steps and autofollow with your outreach. Excited times!

**Pretty sure Cole approves of this one too:**

Disclosure, we’re doing an amazing webinar with these guys next week. [Sign up here](https://leadiq.io/learn/ratemypitchoctober/).

### 4. [Apptus](http://apttus.com/)

 You just sent out a price quote, but will it close?

The crew at Apptus are pushing a movement called the Quote to Cash Movement. They focus on building products to help sales teams take out the mystery with pricing.

They also had a really swanky juice bar at Dreamforce, and everybody loves juice.

**What do you think Cole?**

(Disclaimer, you’ve already this video a dozen times).

### 5. [PandaDoc](https://www.pandadoc.com/)

Panda’s are cute. If you have a problem with that, prove me wrong.

So why not take Panda’s, and integrate them with the way you send out your price quotes?

PandaDoc makes it really easy for your sales team to send out quotes, let customers pick from several packages, and allow your reps track deals after pricing has been sent out. With a slick UI, and templates, they can definitely help automate a ton of the end of the pipeline process.

### Bonus: [Socedo](http://www.socedo.com/)

Once in a great while, you’ll run into someone that is great at social selling. Socedo makes prospecting on social media like this:

Using some cool analytical tools, you can find prospects based on tweets and keywords, and easily get activity logged into Salesforce. We’ll definitely be demoing them for lead generation.

**If Cole says these companies are cool, you know they are.**
