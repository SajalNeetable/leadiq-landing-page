title: Rant on Why Most Sales Prospecting and Marketing Suck
description: >-
  I’m ranting a little today, but that’s because I think this needs to be said.
  There’s a classic scene in the mockumentary "This Is Spinal Tap" where they
  are interviewing one of the guitarists.

  In the scene he shows them his Marshall amp, and he talks about how he’s able
  to dial the amp’s volume to 11.

  Most people laugh at this scene because most amps only to 10, but it makes him
  feel like he’s rocking even harder when he’s playing it at 11.

Here’s the scene for your folks who haven’t seen this classic movie:

Today I want to talk to you about why most marketing, sales, and prospecting sucks, and dialing it up to 11 can fix all these things.  

## Cool buzzwords Ryan, why don’t you shut up and get a haircut?

Listen reader, there is no reason to be rude here. What I’m talking about today is a philosophical way of approaching your work, your leadership, and your future. 

Prospecting, marketing, and sales is not binary. If you are a VP of Sales and you are asking your team to do activities everyday, activities are far too often measured by being complete or incomplete.

Most default CRM and sales enablement tools’ dashboards show the number activities that have been done. That’s because the majority of them are made by people who were trained and beaten to death to sell via activity goals. It’s not their fault. It’s not yours either. 

The problem is,  activities should never be the measuring stick of how well your team is prospecting.

Yes you need to do activities! [(If need help with this, check this post)](https://leadiq.com/blog/how-to-get-more-personalized-prospecting-done). Yes your team needs to work hard.
