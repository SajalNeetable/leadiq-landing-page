title: Rant on Why Most Sales Prospecting and Marketing Suck
description: >-
  I’m ranting a little today, but that’s because I think this needs to be said.
  There’s a classic scene in the mockumentary "This Is Spinal Tap" where they
  are interviewing one of the guitarists.

  In the scene he shows them his Marshall amp, and he talks about how he’s able
  to dial the amp’s volume to 11.

  Most people laugh at this scene because most amps only to 10, but it makes him
  feel like he’s rocking even harder when he’s playing it at 11.
