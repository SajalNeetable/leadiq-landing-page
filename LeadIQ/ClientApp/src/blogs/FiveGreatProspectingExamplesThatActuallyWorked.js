                    description="Last week was a pretty busy week for me. I traveled out to visit many sales teams in the Bay Area to talk about prospecting, and stopped in at Saastr. While there, I kept talking with folks about their favorite prospecting stories, and before long, I had a cool blog post idea. What if I could put together an inspirational post where some of our friends shared their favorite personal prospecting stories of all time? Sometimes it just helps a ton to hear what others are doing to inspire you to take the leap and be different."

                                    “One time, my boss had a referral into an account, but the prospect wouldn’t respond no matter how many times he called/emailed. Then,
                                    he did a bit of research and found out they were a fan of cheese. So…he sent them a book on cheese with a note that said something along
                                    the lines of ‘I know this might be a little cheesy, but I hope you enjoy this and that we can find some time to connect.’  Finally got a good response back and was able to break through.”

                                    “A few weeks ago, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6355162345286754305">I posted a picture of my new office</a>.
                                    In that picture, there is a small white board in the back with a tiny sticker from Death Wish Coffee. Last week, I got a call from the receptionist
                                    explaining that I had a package at the front desk. I opened the package and found a bag of Death Wish Coffee in it with a note congratulating me on
                                    my recent promotion. Once I made it back to my office, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikeypawell/">Mikey Pawell</a> shot me an email explaining
                                    how he found that sticker in the picture I posted to LinkedIn and asked me to set up a call to discuss our caffeine addictions and his company. Obviously,
                                    I took a call out of respect for his efforts. Well done!”

                                    He had been sharing a lot of content recently across all social feeds like Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, and probably even MySpace – so I knew I had to match his tone and reference one of his recent posts to get his
                                    attention. Of all the content he shared, I decided to reference a picture he posted of a bacon-wrapped turkey that he made for Thanksgiving. I told him if he needed an extra person for Easter dinner this year, that
                                    I was his guy. The personal video I made for him in the email also helped get his attention, and he booked a meeting with me to discuss our product. I can share the email thread with you if you’d like!”
