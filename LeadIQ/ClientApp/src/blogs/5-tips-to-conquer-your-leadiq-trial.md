### Tip #1: Grab your prospects right off the web.

Got a dream account you’ve been trying to break into. Visit their company page right on LinkedIn, and browse through their employees. As you are on the profile, open up LeadIQ and you can get your prospect’s phone number in in 1 easy click. We’ll save all your captures right into a campaign for you inside our web app.

### Tip #2: It’s all about the verifies baby!

If you find yourself quickly swooping down on your prospects like a eagle, you may get annoyed writing them a cold email and having it bounce. LeadIQ not only finds email addresses for you, it’ll verify whether the email address is active or not. Check marks mean it has a 95% chance of getting delivered.

Remember, unverified emails don’t count toward your account’s demo credits. The best prospectors only hit up the verified emails.

### Tip #3: Connect LeadIQ to Salesforce.

A true hunter is also a team player. That means not praying on your team member’s prospects, accounts, and opportunities. Connect Salesforce to LeadIQ, and we’ll detect existing records in Salesforce as you browse the web. This saves you LeadIQ credits, and also helps you and team members not fight over the same prospects. After connecting, look for the Salesforce cloud as you browse the web.

You didn’t think we were just going to tell you who is in Salesforce right? You can save prospects from the web right into Salesforce as leads, or contacts in accounts. You can even make a new account when you capture a prospect.

### Tip #4: Use LeadIQ on other sites.

If you find yourself visiting your prospect’s website, reading their blog posts, or visiting their exec team page, you can highlight a name, right click on it, and push it into LeadIQ to find and save their contact information.
