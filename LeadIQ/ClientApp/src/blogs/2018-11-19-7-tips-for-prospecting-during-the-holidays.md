title: 7 Tips for Prospecting During The Holidays
---
## Tip 1: If you are a Sales Development Manager or VP of Sales, be patient. It’s the holidays.

No I’m not asking you to show some Christmas cheer (though that’s welcomed). If you are planning out the month of December, most companies are about to do a big push to close out Q4 strongly. Your SDR team is going to set meetings, but most of them, if not all of them, are not going to close before the end of the year. It doesn’t mean don’t try. It just means you have to be patient, and not force urgency.

Remember, sometimes when an SDR is qualifying something, it’ll take more than one decision maker to sign on to a qualified meeting. Locking DMs down at the end of the year when every department is juggling different days and times for PTO can be difficult, when it’s a brand new deal. 

I remember when I was running some of the conferences and events at Dyn, getting pressure to take a meeting before Christmas with prospective clients. At the time, events were decided by our BDR team,our Director of Marketing, and our Director of Demand Generation. All three of us had very different times off, and we were really focused on finishing up hiring for the following year. 

It really turned me off when the rep kept pushing me to meet prior to January, even though I told them over email it wasn’t going to work in December. I ultimately didn’t respond, and the meeting never happened. 

Your prospects don’t care about your end of the year goals. They don’t care about your Q4 quota, and they definitely don’t care about being rushed in a decision because it fits well with your fiscal year agenda. Put your prospects first, and maybe loosen the qualification standards a little bit in December. You don’t want to have December hurt moral with your prospectors. 

You can yell at your team about hustle, and blabber about pipeline all you want, but it’s better for your prospecting team to kick off January well than it is to end the prospecting year strong.

Obviously it’d be nice to do both, but you have to be patient and put your prospects first. 

If the rep respected my wish to pull in my other two teammates, and do it in January, we likely could have got something on the books in December for January. Which brings me to my next point. 

## Tip 2: Send an actual calendar invite for January.

Oh man, this one drives me nuts! I used to see reps on my team get the objection we just talked about, and to reach back out in the new year. You know what a ton of reps do? 

They thank them, create a task to reach back out, and move on to the next prospect.

**WRONG!**

If you wrote a good personalized email or had a great call, get something on the books in January NOW. If the prospect is uncomfortable with booking that far ahead, in the calendar, tell them the invite can also serve as a reminder for both of you to schedule in the event it doesn’t work. 

### Here’s an example of a good calendar to send:

I’d recommend setting up an extra notification in your calendar invite. I usually do this one for 24 hours out so the prospect doesn’t forget about the meeting. Most calendars only have a reminder for 10 minutes before the meeting by default, so you may have to tweak your invite by adding an extra notification. 

Remember to also remind them what the hell happened in December. As a decision maker here, I sometimes have so much going on that it becomes difficult to remember what the calendar is about. 

Nothing is worse than the prospect not being prepared to discuss the topic of your first call in your sales process as well. 

If the prospect doesn’t accept the invite, don’t be afraid to shoot them a reminder. 

The 24 hour calendar reminder for the prospect can also serve as a reminder to you to check back in with your prospect. 


## Tip 3: The best way to do a remind a prospect about your meeting is over text message. 

Calling from my experience is too intrusive since they already agreed to a call. It also may seem kind of salesy to redo a cold call.  

If your prospect is like me, and sees an email next to many of their unread emails, it’ll remind them just how busy they actually are. 

Remember, you want to be friendly with your prospects. Put some personality into your text. If they have buying power, they are likely extraordinary people. They deserve extraordinary outreach.

Here’s an example of one I’d send if I joked with a prospect on a cold call about rat tails.
