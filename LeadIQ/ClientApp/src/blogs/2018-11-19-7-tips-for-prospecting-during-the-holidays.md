description: >-
  Let’s not sugar coat it everyone. No bullshit. I’m just going to say what
  everyone is thinking. Prospecting during the holidays is one the hardest
  things to do. We are about to enter the armpit of Christmas cheer, the out of
  office Kwanza bandanza, the I’m not interested, don’t you realize it’s
  Hanukkah season. Or some call it, the holidays!

  You know what stinks though. WE STILL HAVE QUOTAS!

  Today, I thought I’d put together a post on some prospecting tips to help you
  reach your goals throughout one of the most challenging times to do sales
  development.

## Tip 1: If you are a Sales Development Manager or VP of Sales, be patient. It’s the holidays.

No I’m not asking you to show some Christmas cheer (though that’s welcomed). If you are planning out the month of December, most companies are about to do a big push to close out Q4 strongly. Your SDR team is going to set meetings, but most of them, if not all of them, are not going to close before the end of the year. It doesn’t mean don’t try. It just means you have to be patient, and not force urgency.

Remember, sometimes when an SDR is qualifying something, it’ll take more than one decision maker to sign on to a qualified meeting. Locking DMs down at the end of the year when every department is juggling different days and times for PTO can be difficult, when it’s a brand new deal. 

I remember when I was running some of the conferences and events at Dyn, getting pressure to take a meeting before Christmas with prospective clients. At the time, events were decided by our BDR team,our Director of Marketing, and our Director of Demand Generation. All three of us had very different times off, and we were really focused on finishing up hiring for the following year. 

It really turned me off when the rep kept pushing me to meet prior to January, even though I told them over email it wasn’t going to work in December. I ultimately didn’t respond, and the meeting never happened. 

Your prospects don’t care about your end of the year goals. They don’t care about your Q4 quota, and they definitely don’t care about being rushed in a decision because it fits well with your fiscal year agenda. Put your prospects first, and maybe loosen the qualification standards a little bit in December. You don’t want to have December hurt moral with your prospectors. 

You can yell at your team about hustle, and blabber about pipeline all you want, but it’s better for your prospecting team to kick off January well than it is to end the prospecting year strong.

Obviously it’d be nice to do both, but you have to be patient and put your prospects first. 

If the rep respected my wish to pull in my other two teammates, and do it in January, we likely could have got something on the books in December for January. Which brings me to my next point. 

## Tip 2: Send an actual calendar invite for January.

Oh man, this one drives me nuts! I used to see reps on my team get the objection we just talked about, and to reach back out in the new year. You know what a ton of reps do? 

They thank them, create a task to reach back out, and move on to the next prospect.

**WRONG!**

If you wrote a good personalized email or had a great call, get something on the books in January NOW. If the prospect is uncomfortable with booking that far ahead, in the calendar, tell them the invite can also serve as a reminder for both of you to schedule in the event it doesn’t work. 

### Here’s an example of a good calendar to send:

![tom-calendar.png](img/tom-calendar.png)

I’d recommend setting up an extra notification in your calendar invite. I usually do this one for 24 hours out so the prospect doesn’t forget about the meeting. Most calendars only have a reminder for 10 minutes before the meeting by default, so you may have to tweak your invite by adding an extra notification. 

Remember to also remind them what the hell happened in December. As a decision maker here, I sometimes have so much going on that it becomes difficult to remember what the calendar is about. 

Nothing is worse than the prospect not being prepared to discuss the topic of your first call in your sales process as well. 

If the prospect doesn’t accept the invite, don’t be afraid to shoot them a reminder. 

The 24 hour calendar reminder for the prospect can also serve as a reminder to you to check back in with your prospect. 


## Tip 3: The best way to do a remind a prospect about your meeting is over text message. 

Calling from my experience is too intrusive since they already agreed to a call. It also may seem kind of salesy to redo a cold call.  

If your prospect is like me, and sees an email next to many of their unread emails, it’ll remind them just how busy they actually are. 

Remember, you want to be friendly with your prospects. Put some personality into your text. If they have buying power, they are likely extraordinary people. They deserve extraordinary outreach.

Here’s an example of one I’d send if I joked with a prospect on a cold call about rat tails.

## Tip 4: If you use sales engagement software for prospecting, build a reminder sequence or cadence.

If you are using cadence or sequence software like Outreach or SalesLoft, I’d recommend building a series of reminders for all the prospects the second they say they are down to talk in the upcoming year. 

You can boilerplate about 60% of your email, and make the other 40% reference what you talked about with the prospect in December. 

![outreach.png](outreach.png)

I’d do a 2 or three step sequence or cadence. The first step being a text, the next being an email, and finally a call if the prospect no shows the meeting.  I’d do both steps 1 and 2 within 24 hours of each other to do what people call, the Double Tap. 

## Tip 5: If you are working the week between Christmas and New Years, use the Send Later function with your personalized cold email.

Spending years as a prospector, I can count on one hand the amount of deals I’ve brought in that closed in less than 30 days. 

Think of the outcome of your prospect for a second. Even if you or your team members setup a great meeting the second or third week of December, a lot of the deal momentum can die because of the holidays. It’s important to try and close someone when their interest is highest. How much will their interest drop if they disappear from the office for a week? 

If you have a short sales cycle, than you can ignore this, but generally speaking, most companies we talk with have at least a two or three month sales cycle on outbound deals. 

As a result, I recommend you spend the latter half of December writing personalized emails that will go out the first few weeks in January. 

![sendlater.png](sendlater.png)

Usually you can find the Send Later function next to the send button on whatever application you are using. 

If you are a VP of Sales seeing this, or in charge of a prospecting team..I’m not saying give up! I’m just saying that you have to think about your sales reps who get the deals once they respond as well. They are focusing on closing out the year strong, so even if you give them a new deal to work this month, their attention may not be as great as it may be in the new year. 

When you set the send later time, make sure it isn’t a time that rounds to a exact hour or half hour. It’ll make your email look programmed. 

## Tip 6: Don’t send emails with the subject _Happy Holidays_

I always tell reps that they have to be peacocks. They have find a way to stand out when they prospect. Let me tell you what doesn’t stand out. Using the subject, Happy Holidays, any time after Thanksgiving to New Years. I did a subject search from my inbox and found over 23 emails with that subject line. 

![happy-holidays-emails.png](img/happy-holidays-emails.png)

I’ve made this mistake myself two years back, and from my experience, you’ll get a better open rate using a different subject line with your emails. 

## Tip 7: Use the holidays to produce an interesting prospecting campaign.

A few years ago, when LeadIQ’s office was really tiny, we were trying to find a way to do something nice for our customers for the holidays.

Our team was kicking around a couple of ideas. Our CTO Angelo bought a bunch of portable chargers with our old logo on it with the intent of using them as gifts. This was actually debated for a little while. We ended up mailing some of the chargers to a few prospects. 

![power brick.jpg](img/power brick.jpg)

Logistically, I sort of felt like while the gifts were useful, we wouldn’t be able to do something after the holidays with them as well. 

There also a limit of how many we could afford given the cost (they were roughly $20 per power brick). 

With so much of our prospecting going unanswered at this time of year, what if we did something with our time that made the outreach better once they come back to work? 

### So we ended up doing this for prospects:

The plan was simple. We decided it’d be really cool to hire a String Quartet,  and asked them to learn a few classic rock songs. Based on our prospect’s interest, we paired up songs with the musical taste of our prospects. 

After recording a video to our prospects on a webcam, we intro’d them to the backroom of our tiny office, turning on the lights, and revealing the quartet!

The cool part is we were able to crank out about 30 of these over the course of an 8 hour session with the quartet.

### Why did we do this?

Think of how unique the follow up can be for something like this. 

> Hey Kelly, did you see that video we sent you with the song? What’d you think?” over a cold call certainly beats, “Hey Kelly..do you have a few minutes to talk? LeadIQ blah blah blah...

If the prospect didn’t respond, we followed up with a tweet of the video at the company tag, plus the prospect’s tag if they had one. 

![tweetsproutsocial.png](img/tweetsproutsocial.png)

The campaign ended up yielding a 44% opportunity rate over the course of Q1 of the follow year. That means it generated 13 opps for one day of work. Total cost: $300

The holidays don’t need to be a sales reps death sentence. It’s a good time to put your head down, and do some really cool experiments with prospecting. Just make sure you hit the go button in January with it.
