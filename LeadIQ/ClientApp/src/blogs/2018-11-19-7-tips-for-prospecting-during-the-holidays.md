title: 7 Tips for Prospecting During The Holidays
---
## Tip 1: If you are a Sales Development Manager or VP of Sales, be patient. It’s the holidays.

No I’m not asking you to show some Christmas cheer (though that’s welcomed). If you are planning out the month of December, most companies are about to do a big push to close out Q4 strongly. Your SDR team is going to set meetings, but most of them, if not all of them, are not going to close before the end of the year. It doesn’t mean don’t try. It just means you have to be patient, and not force urgency.

Remember, sometimes when an SDR is qualifying something, it’ll take more than one decision maker to sign on to a qualified meeting. Locking DMs down at the end of the year when every department is juggling different days and times for PTO can be difficult, when it’s a brand new deal. 

I remember when I was running some of the conferences and events at Dyn, getting pressure to take a meeting before Christmas with prospective clients. At the time, events were decided by our BDR team,our Director of Marketing, and our Director of Demand Generation. All three of us had very different times off, and we were really focused on finishing up hiring for the following year. 

It really turned me off when the rep kept pushing me to meet prior to January, even though I told them over email it wasn’t going to work in December. I ultimately didn’t respond, and the meeting never happened.
