title: What Metrics Every Sales Development Manager Should Be Measuring
description: >-
  Over the past few years here at LeadIQ, we’ve gone through many different team
  members prospecting. Some of our Sales Development Reps make it through our
  rigorous onboarding, stay there, move on, or get moved into other roles, 
  while some sadly perish into the mighty night.

  Cough cough...wow that got really dramatic for some reason. It’s scary to
  admit, but we’ve had some failed hires. It’s no secret that hitting quota is
  hard. Salesforce says that 63% of sales reps will miss their quota this month.


  Yesterday we went through the data in our prospecting platforms to calculate
  why some reps make it here, and others haven’t. As we were doing this process,
  we realized that measuring success goes way deeper than just looking at
  opportunities. Today I’m going to talk about how sales leaders should measure
  how well their team is doing with cold prospecting.  I’m going to show you
  what we call internally our Prospecting Efficiency Score, or PES for short.
