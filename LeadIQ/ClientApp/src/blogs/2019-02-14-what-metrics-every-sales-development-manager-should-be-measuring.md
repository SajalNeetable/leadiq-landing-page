title: What Metrics Every Sales Development Manager Should Be Measuring
description: >-
  Over the past few years here at LeadIQ, we’ve gone through many different team
  members prospecting. Some of our Sales Development Reps make it through our
  rigorous onboarding, stay there, move on, or get moved into other roles, 
  while some sadly perish into the mighty night. Cough cough...wow that got
  really dramatic for some reason. It’s scary to admit, but we’ve had some
  failed hires. It’s no secret that hitting quota is hard. Salesforce says that
  63% of sales reps will miss their quota this month. Yesterday we went through
  the data in our prospecting platforms to calculate why some reps make it here,
  and others haven’t. As we were doing this process, we realized that measuring
  success goes way deeper than just looking at opportunities. Today I’m going to
  talk about how sales leaders should measure how well their team is doing with
  cold prospecting.  I’m going to show you what we call internally our
  Prospecting Efficiency Score, or PES for short.

## What is the Prospecting Efficiency Score? ##

The Prospecting Efficiency Score, or we call it, PES, is the way we determine how well reps are doing, and where they need coaching.

This equation is super important for telling you almost the whole story with your reps and where they need help. We’ll go into why each part of the equation is important to measure independently. 

### Let’s start with the obvious inputs you need to do measurements.


Okay! I know reps have quotas for producing opportunities. Obviously opportunities are the output of what a rep puts in with prospecting, and then the next thing you look at is “Closed Won” opportunities. 

The problem is, especially if you have full time outbound prospectors, these numbers don’t help you identify what’s going on with each rep’s prospecting. 

The goal of these equations is to explain how they work, why they are important, and how to diagnose problems or successes you may be having with your prospecting. 


### What tools do you need to measure?

In my opinion, if you really care about helping your team, you need to have some sort of tool for measuring the number of touches a rep has done, how many opportunities they have, and the number of replies. 

If you don’t have these three things, you should setup a CRM and use reporting,  or get a sales engagement platform that will help measure replies. In my opinion having a dialer combined with emailing is usually the easiest way to attack this. 

## Equation #1: Response Rate ##

Ok. First things first, you’ll need to calculate your Response Rate. A good response rate will tell us how effective your cold emails, social, and cold calling activities are. Generally speaking, we have a pretty high bar at LeadIQ. 

If we see a rep isn’t hitting close to at least a 10% response rate, we usually focus a lot of attention on them because a low response rate could soil our good name we’ve worked so hard to create.
