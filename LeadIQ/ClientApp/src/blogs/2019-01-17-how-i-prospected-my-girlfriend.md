title: How I Prospected My Girlfriend

How You Present Yourself Matters: 

Before all the ladies called me Papi Chulo, I was just regular Rishi “Ricky” Mathur. Ricky was given to me from the powers at Yext. They discovered for me to do my job properly I needed to change my name, Rishi was very difficult to pronounce in the midwest. But Ricky just rolled right off the tongue.

Anyway, at that time all I did was exercise, perform stand-up, sell powerlistings and constantly swipe right on Tinder. Just to clarify before I am labeled misogynist, I would like the record to show I only swiped right on every girl because I am an equal opportunist (not thirsty). Unfortunately, they did not share my views, they on the other hand were very picky. It seemed almost very aggressive, like there is a conspiracy against me.
