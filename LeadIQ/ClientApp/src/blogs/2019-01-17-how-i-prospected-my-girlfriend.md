title: How I Prospected My Girlfriend

How You Present Yourself Matters: 

Before all the ladies called me Papi Chulo, I was just regular Rishi “Ricky” Mathur. Ricky was given to me from the powers at Yext. They discovered for me to do my job properly I needed to change my name, Rishi was very difficult to pronounce in the midwest. But Ricky just rolled right off the tongue.

Anyway, at that time all I did was exercise, perform stand-up, sell powerlistings and constantly swipe right on Tinder. Just to clarify before I am labeled misogynist, I would like the record to show I only swiped right on every girl because I am an equal opportunist (not thirsty). Unfortunately, they did not share my views, they on the other hand were very picky. It seemed almost very aggressive, like there is a conspiracy against me.  

I went to my coworker, he advised me about his methods of using Tinder. He showed me every aspect of his profile is tailored to show a different side to him. He then showed me two types of pictures: 1) proper types of pictures to post and 2) pictures which should never see the light of day or as he puts it “these need to burn in the cloud.” This blew my mind, it reminded me of how restaurants would enhance the pictures of their food to seem more appealing.

The more I stared at the emptiness the more terrified I became. This is essentially very similar to a cold email, if I make it too generic I am no different than any of the other Anthony Weiner's sending messages. 

If I make it too personalized then she will think I’m a creep. I need to have this message be witty, charming and personalized enough where it doesn’t seem like I am spamming her. 

Even after all that, there is still a high risk she never replies.   

 “...the average open rates for business emails hover between 14% and 23%”. 
Do Not Be Generic (Sheep-like)
“The key to a Tinder opener is attention. This girl is getting 10,000 "heys" a day from a bunch of schlubs who have nothing to offer her. If you send her another "hey" then what makes you worth talking to? Your winning smile? Newsflash. There are winning smiles elsewhere found in nature.” 
After studying many dating app messages, I noticed people are boring.  But more importantly each of these messages look very similar to a business cold email. Very
