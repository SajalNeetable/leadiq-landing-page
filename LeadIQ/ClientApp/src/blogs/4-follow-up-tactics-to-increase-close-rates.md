### [Close.io](http://close.io/?utm_campaign=gpcodra&utm_medium=guestpost&utm_source=LeadIQ)‘s CEO shares the best ways to do follow up with leads.

Imagine marketing sends over your dream prospect: High profile, high budget, and clearly in need of your solution.

You send out a cold email and spend the rest of the day fantasizing about their response (and your commission).

Then the day ends, and you haven’t heard anything. But they’re probably just busy, right? You’ll have a response by morning.

And then that day comes and goes. Then another. And another. Soon it’s been a week and you still haven’t gotten a response. So much for the deal of a lifetime.

What happened? Hopefully the answer is obvious: You failed to follow up. Every salesperson knows they should, but most don’t know how; so [a lot of ‘em don’t.](http://blog.hubspot.com/sales/sales-statistics#sm.00001iwlssbpuodnewlv7asdja16k)

Let’s change that. Here’s a 14-day schedule outlining the whats, whens, ifs, and hows of the cold email follow up.

### Day 1: Initial outreach

I’m sure you already know [how to write a cold email](http://blog.close.io/six-simple-steps-to-getting-started-with-cold-sales-emails?utm_campaign=gpcodra&utm_medium=guestpost&utm_source=LeadIQ), but let’s review. Effective cold emails have three primary components:

### 1\. Compelling subject lines

The subject line is the most important part of your cold email. If you don’t spark your prospect’s interest immediately, you’ve lost your chance. Here are a couple quick tips to [get more out of your cold email subject lines:](http://blog.close.io/subject-lines?utm_campaign=gpcodra&utm_medium=guestpost&utm_source=LeadIQ)

*   **Write like a human being**, to a human being. No catchy slogans or too-good-to-be-true deals. Use your prospect’s name, and write something they want to read.
*   **Forget title capitalization**. Capitalizing every word makes your email look like a marketing email, and no one wants to open a marketing email.
*   **Ask questions**. [Good questions](http://blog.close.io/13-killer-b2b-sales-questions-to-close-more-deals?utm_campaign=gpcodra&utm_medium=guestpost&utm_source=LeadIQ) make your prospects want to know more. Invite them into a conversation instead of just talking at them.

Remember: An unopened email is no different from an unsent email. If you’re going to invest time in any one part of a cold email, make it the subject line.

### 2\. Captivating content

_As much as we want machines and humans to get along, you’re prospecting to a human being. So be human!_

[Great content](http://blog.close.io/how-to-improve-your-cold-email-response-rates?utm_campaign=gpcodra&utm_medium=guestpost&utm_source=LeadIQ) operates on the same principles as great subject lines: Write like a human being, to a human being. No one is going to open a cold email if they think they’re going to be sold to.

Lower their defenses by saying something like this: “I know you get dozens of these emails every week and you probably delete most of them. But before you delete mine, give me a chance to explain why I’m writing to you, and why you should care. It’ll take two minutes of your time, tops.”

Then get to it. Introduce yourself, your product, and the solution you offer. But the most important part of your content comes at the end: Make sure you leave them with a clear call-to-action.

Tell them exactly what you want them to do (respond, sign up for a trial, buy a product, etc), and how to do it.

### 3\. Engaging signatures

Email signatures are the most overlooked part of cold email campaigns. For most people, their signature is nothing more than their name, title, and phone number. Talk about wasted space.

Here are a few things you might consider linking to in your cold email signature:

*   **Your blog.** If your company has a blog, link to it. If you can think of one article in particular that would be valuable to this prospect, send them that.
*   **Social media**. Assuming you have high-value, high-quality social media accounts, give your prospect the opportunity to connect with you.
*   **Industry data.** Everyone likes learning something new. Find some interesting data that supports your product and share it as a “fun fact” at the end of your signature.

Finishing strong is just as important as starting strong, so make sure you go out with a bang.

### Day 3: Timing is everything

One of the most common reasons cold emails get ignored is because they were sent at inopportune times. Maybe you emailed while your prospect was at lunch, in a meeting, or on the phone.

Overcome this by following up at a different time of day. For example, if your initial email was sent in the morning, following up around 1:00pm.

You may be familiar with the research around the “best” time to send a cold email. That information can be valuable, but keep in mind that it’s available to every other salesperson and marketer, too.

That means if you send your message at the “best” time, you’ll be competing with everyone else sending a cold email that day. Sometimes it’s better to go against the data and stand out from the rest.

The email itself should not contain any new information. Use this follow-up email to convey the same information in a new way. Try different wording, alternate formatting, or a better subject line.

### Day 7: Call me, maybe?

_Carly Rae Jepsen: Sales Genius?_

Like before, send this email at a different time of day. If you’ve already tried morning and afternoon, send this email sometime in the evening.

This follow-up email should be short and focused on getting your prospect on the phone. For example:

“Hey here again. Just wanted to follow up on my last couple emails. I’d love to set up a time for a quick ten-minute call so we can explore whether or not our solution would be a good fit for your business. How about Wednesday at 10am?”

A short email like this makes it easy for your prospect to skim and respond. It doesn’t require link clicking or a 3-paragraph response; all they have to do is say, “Yes,” or, “No.”

_Breaking up with a prospect is never easy._

### Day 14: Break up with your prospect

If you haven’t heard anything from your prospect in two weeks, it’s time to [break up with them](http://blog.close.io/the-breakup-email?utm_campaign=gpcodra&utm_medium=guestpost&utm_source=LeadIQ). But don’t worry: This stage is actually where you’re going to see your response rates skyrocket.

A successful breakup email plays into your prospect’s fear of missing out. When they think you’re going to take the deal away from them, you become a much greater priority.

Start with a really good subject line, like:

*   Goodbye from your name/your business
*   Permission to close your account?
*   It’s not you. It’s me.

Keep the content itself short, and make sure it clearly communicates these five points:

*   1\. I’ve repeatedly try to do something good for you
*   2\. You haven’t replied
*   3\. This is the last time I’ll contact you
*   4\. If you change your mind, I’d love to speak with you more
*   5\. Here’s my contact information

Need a more visual example? Check out this great breakup email from Trunk Club:

You’ll probably find that the majority of your cold leads won’t respond until you send them the breakup email. But make sure you don’t send it unless you’re serious about letting them go. There’s no coming back from this.

If you still don’t get a response, move on and invest your time in more receptive clients.

### The 2-week challenge

Whether you’re pursuing warm leads or cold, one thing is always true: **Sales success is about relentless follow-up**, and it’s too important to leave to chance.

Turn follow-up into an integral part of your sales process. If you use [a sales CRM that supports follow-up](http://close.io/?utm_campaign=gpcodra&utm_medium=guestpost&utm_source=LeadIQ), make the most of it: Utilize reminders, workflows, and read/response detection to give you an edge.

If you don’t have a follow-up-friendly CRM, create a manual system. Use calendars, phone reminders, and sticky notes if that’s what it takes. Because in the end, **the salesperson who follows up is the salesperson who closes the deal.**

Here’s my challenge to you: Starting today, incorporate this follow-up schedule into your sales cycle; just to see if it makes a difference. And when it does (and it will), come back and share your experience in the comments below.

Sound good? Great. Now get out there and crush it.
