title: The Mindset of a High-Performing SDR
description: >-
  Let's dive right in and whiteboard this:

  You see the difference? The low-performing SDR has this defeatist mindset. In
  their head, the prospect is way above them and the SDR isn't worthy of their
  time.

  This is the biggest challenge that SDRs have. Getting over this mental hump.

Think about it. SDRs are typically calling high level decision makers. The C-Suite and VPs, or at least director level executives. These are people who often times have decades of experience in their field, certifications, awards, accolades. They've been there and done that.

Yet we're having SDRs call them. SDRs who typically are young, inexperienced, 1st / 2nd job out of college. They don't have a degree in the industry they're prospecting into - let alone one in sales.



## I call this the SDR Paradox .

So what's the solution? How can these junior level SDRs possibly be expected to have effective business conversations with seasoned executives?

It comes down to the mindset. SDRs need that high-performing mindset, they must view the prospect and themselves as equals. This is the biggest thing that separates high performing SDRs from the low-performing.

How do you get that high-performing mindset?

- Self-belief
- Product belief
- Preparation

**Okay, now let's unpack each of them.**

### Self-belief

Confidence is super important. It might seem obvious that if you're in sales you need to have confidence. But there's way more sales jobs out there than there is good salespeople. Many people who are in sales don't have the necessary level of confidence to do the job. The weak, timid, 'woe is me', down in the dumps types of people will not succeed in sales. These people walk with their heads down and slowly, they talk softly on the phone. Confident SDRs are loud, everyone else in the office knows when they're on calls, they stand up. They walk tall, with purpose and with their head up.

Also falling under the umbrella of self-belief is mental toughness. Mental toughness is also very important in the SDR role. In the beginning you're going to get rejected 9/10 times, maybe even 19/20. You need to be able to quickly bounce back, not let it get you down and move on to the next call with optimism - knowing you're that much closer to a 'yes'. Mental toughness is a must.

This confidence and optimism comes through in your tone when you speak with prospects on the phone. SDRs, every time you speak with a prospective client they are making a judgement. They're either going to come away from that interaction thinking that you're bored with your job or passionate about it. Some of it comes through in your words, but most of it is about the tone, the inflection, how loud/fast you speak. So how do your prospects think you sound - bored...or passionate??

_One way to sound more passionate and less bored on the phone is by standing up while you're on the phone!_

### Product belief

To succeed you need to have a crystal clear picture of exactly what value your product provides in the marketplace and be able to articulate it in a clear/concise manner. You need to truly believe that your product is the sh!t.

If you don't then you need more training. Go check out your company's case studies. Talk to your product team. Get on a call with marketing. Find out who the top sales rep at your company is and pick his brain. Ask your manager for help.

If you still can't get passionate about your company's mission - find a new company!

Once you do have the necessary level of product belief, your performance as an SDR will improve dramatically. You'll have a greater sense of purpose, like every meeting you set is going to lead to something big. You'll no longer downplay the meetings by saying to your prospects things like, "can we just do a demo?" or, "It will be 15-20 minutes, tops."

Most importantly, you will never apologize to your prospects ever again.
