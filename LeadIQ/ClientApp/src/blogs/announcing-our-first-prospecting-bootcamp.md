**This blog post exists solely to give you the skinny on how this whole thing is going to work.**

If you want to save some time, you should check out the info on the actual site, and RSVP because we have limited spots open. [Here’s the link to sign up](https://leadiq.io/learn/bootcamp/) again.

### Here are some quick answers for you!

#### How does this thing work?

To start with, we’re going to be hosting this event on the 14th floor of WeWork’s TransBay office in San Francisco.

_WeWork’s TransBay co-working space on 535 Mission Street is more diesel than Vin Diesel._

Attendees will gather, and listen to two really quick talks by [Ben Parr](http://twitter.com/benparr) (who you likely know just because he’s Ben Parr), and [Ryan O’Hara](http://twitter.com/ryohara) (who you likely don’t know because he isn’t Ben Parr).

Ben recently wrote a super amazing book called [Captivology: The Science of Capturing People’s Attention.](https://www.amazon.com/Captivology-Science-Capturing-Peoples-Attention/dp/1481533592) He’ll share wisdom on trends he noticed studying how startup founders and businesses have attracted other’s attentions.

**_Wait…isn’t that something that we try to do when we email prospect?_**

….Yup. That’s why we asked Ben to speak. He’s the man.

After Ben, Ryan will be give a talk about how he and a small team of 3 sales reps turned [Dyn](http://dyn.com/) into one of the fastest growing 400+ people B2B startups on the East Coast just using cold emails and smart prospecting tactics.

After Ryan’s talk is done, we’ll break for food (there will be pizza and drinks provided), followed by the most intriguing part of the night: **RateMyPitch Live!**

### What the hell is RateMyPitch Live?

Imagine a world, where before the event, we’ll email all attendees and ask them to send us one cold email each, like they were cold emailing a customer. Then imagine we assembled a panel of 3 sales experts and 3 potential buyers.

That’s RateMyPitch Live! We’ll give you the option to send emails and block out their info if they’d like, and have the panel analyze your cold emails in front of a live audience.

Obviously, not every attendee’s emails will be picked, but we’ll try and go through as many as we can and give perspective on each cold email we review. All attendees after the event will have the option to get a written rating of their emails.

### So should I attend this event?

You should attend this event if you work in startups, and have to deal with people to make your job successful.

This is a great event for SDRs, Business Development folks, startup founders, CEOs, marketers, and sales leaders.

If you send cold emails and don’t get at least a 10% reply rate, you should definitely go to this event.

**_…I crush that number…should I still go?_**

Well if you send cold emails and get below a 20% reply rate, we’ll give you some new ideas and feedback that could shoot you past 30% reply rates.

**_…I also crush that number…should I still go?_**

If you’re really wise and great at cold emailing people, we’d love to have you be part of the discussion either way.

Those who attend will get some inspirational prospecting ideas, and more importantly, change the way you think about prospecting.

### I don’t live in the Bay Area? What now?

Why did you read this far down in the blog post?

#### Okay…you got me. Where do I RSVP again?
