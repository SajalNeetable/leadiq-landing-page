By the way, you should read those articles before you read this one. Today I’m going to show you another archetype that is very hard to execute, but if done right, is incredible.

As a grown 31 year old man, one person that shamelessly pops into my mind as a good example of success using another archetype is singer/songwriter Taylor Swift.

### How the hell has Taylor Swift built her brand?

Have you ever worked with a brand that made you feel like an insider? Think of some of your closest business relationships. Do you celebrate them when promoting your product or service prospecting?

Lover brands are all about intimacy, and Taylor Swift is all about intimacy.

_Taylor Swift performing in Sydney back in 2012 during her Speak Now Tour. Over the past decade, Swift as a Lover brand is one of the Top 5 best selling music artist in the world._

While physical attraction can be a part of this archetype, meaning dressing up, looking formal, looking your best, it really is about loyalty, intimacy, and companionship with your prospects. Are you celebrating them and talking about how much you love them? Are you sharing deep conversations and being intimate with them?

If you pay attention to pop culture, tell me the biggest difference between Taylor Swift and any of the other musical artists out there? Why is she in a different stratosphere of fame compared to Lorde or Carly Rae Jepsen?

_I know that Taylor Swift has a country music following, but look at these monthly listeners. She’s been doing this for over 15 years and has stayed relevant._

Obviously she is talented, but that’s not the whole story. Compared to other musical acts over the years, Swift has managed to grow a large loyal following through the way she’s branded herself as a Lover.

There are tons of musical acts that come and go, but it’s rare to see someone who has sustained success like Swift.

She has created a huge community of loyal fans who not only buy her music and tickets to see her on tour, but also loyally defend her whenever controversy emerges.

_Taylor Swift and Katy Perry are both huge pop stars. A few years ago, it was reported that the two had a falling out due to Perry hiring all of Swift’s touring dancers a few days before Swift’s tour. In response, thousands of Taylor Swift fans boycotted listening to Perry’s new album. Swift is rumored to have written a song about their feud, which happened to be number one single called “Bad Blood.”_

Imagine if you could get your prospects and customers to defend the wall when something negative emerges? What if a competitor says something negative about your company online?

Originally stemming out of the country music scene, over the past 10 years, Swift has changed her music, sound, and genre dramatically since she first emerged, and has found success in every music scene, without alienating her core country music fan base. As a result, that fanbase has grown into hundreds of millions of streams and downloads.

The one thing that has helped her transition into popular mainstream audiences is the consistency with her brand. That consistency of her executing the Lover brand archetype.

Unlike Ali or Bermeister (who we reference in [this article](https://leadiq.com/2018/09/proof-that-the-ruler-brand-archetype-works/)), Swift doesn’t talk about having the most listens on Spotify, or the most followers on Instagram. This is because she isn’t a Ruler brand. It’d be severely off-brand for her to do this.

Her archetype makes it easy for her to keep an audience engaged, regardless of changes in what she is selling. The same will apply to you as a sales rep prospecting. If you change jobs, you don’t need to necessarily change your personal brand.

Swift’s music is known for revealing intimate thoughts and stories about her life. She gives listeners a deep understanding of feelings and experiences she’s going through. Her music is almost like listening to an autobiography of the past few years since her last album.

_Can you believe how much I’m talking about Taylor Swift? Yeah it makes me want to cry too. Seriously though, she has 109 million followers on Instagram! What are we even doing?_

_When thinking of differentiators between different musical artist, Taylor Swift’s online following is larger than Katy Perry’s thanks to her better execution of the Lover brand archetype._

Whether it’s songs about breakups,growing up, her well known feuds with Katy Perry or Kayne West, or songs about dealing with fame, Swift’s use of the Lover brand’s intimacy to connect with her fans is executed perfectly.

Taylor Swift is almost always dressed up formally to fit into this brand when she performs, playing into physical sides of the Lover brand. She performs at Victoria Secret’s annual fashion show (another well known Lover brand), and has even taken models on tour with her.

She wants fans to see her at her physical best. This is part of the brand and how she goes to market. On social media, a lot of her posts show fans glimpses into her life with her friends in New York City, videos of her cat, or song writing in the studio.

Another important part of the Lover brand is showing your customers and prospects that you love them, and rewarding them with intimacy. A good example of this is Taylor Swift surprising fans by crashing their weddings, birthday parties, and responding to their social media posts with videos.

One famous stunt that Swift did that fits into the Lover brand archetype is a stunt fans called Swiftmas. A few years back, Taylor Swift found random fans online that follow her, and surprised them by sending gifts in the mail. She even delivered some by hand. To promote the campaign, she asked them to record opening the gifts and post to social tagging her

For several days, videos everywhere emerged as hundreds of fans read, recorded, and opened gifts, and the Swift’s loyalty to fans was front and center.

Swift isn’t a product or service. She is an individual brand, just like you and me.

In the videos, some of her fans are crying, others are laughing, and for the ones she does in person, almost all of them have a hug in there. This is the power that a brand archetype can carry.

### Okay. That’s probably enough about Taylor Swift right? What the hell is wrong with me?

Let’s try and related someone else doing the Lover archetype that isn’t a pop star.

One person and brand that is helping the same audience that Chad Burmeister is trying to target is [Kyle Porter](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyleporter/), CEO of SalesLoft. [SalesLoft](http://salesloft.com) as a company is pushing toward the Lover brand archetype by talking about their love of their customers. Based on their revenue numbers and growth, it’s working.

_The team at SalesLoft is all about showing love for their customers. They emphasize the word love in their marketing. This post I found from Shaun Krilanovich shows that they are willing to go onsite to help prospects with sales advice._

This past spring the brand launched a marketing campaign called #SalesLove where they emphasize sales reps showing love for their customers. Porter as an executive is all about showing love to his employees and sales as a profession. His post are carefully crafted to emphasize this, and as a result, there are many SalesLoft and Kyle Porter loyalists out there.

_This post is showing Porter and SalesLoft following the Lover archetype._

We all crave intimacy, and want to feel like we have a special companion, and they take advantage of that. By focusing on it as a foundation of not just SalesLoft, but Porter’s brand, he’s been able to build a great following online, and see loyalty with his customers.

These are two big brands doing the lover archetype. As you are picking from our collection of the 12 archetypes, it’s important to pick one and stick with it.
