### Get the account-based edge to crush your quota

Even if your boss doesn’t ask, if you really want the edge as that >100% quota-boaster, you need to get specific and targeted with your search. You’ll want to find accounts that match not only company size, but perhaps sell B2B products, are at a certain level of investment stage, are in a specific location, have a certain department size that you sell into, or use a specific technology. You’ll obviously need to figure out what to search for but I can at least guide you to some free-ish tools that will enable it.

These under-utilized tools are perfect for finding accounts with the filters listed above.

### It’s free

All of these tools not only have free trials in which you can easily build a hefty, well-targeted account list on, but they do an amazing job of giving you accurate data on them too.

### Get a solid kick-start in your prospecting

If you’re just kicking off your sales efforts at a startup or trying to fight your way in a new territory at a mature company, these two tools will put you ahead of the curve.
