Whether it’s what accounts you go after, if the contact you picked at that account is the right person, what time you did your tactic, or maybe you just wrote bad email copy, anything can go wrong impacting your response rates.

                                <h3>Sales reps introducing themselves in their cold emails.</h3>

                                <p>
                                    GASP! That’s right. This is something that comes up in almost every bad cold email I look at. When I go and pick what cold emails I’m
                                   going to feature in a RateMyPitch, I always make sure to pick an email that teaches this lesson. We’ve all done it. We have these mental
                                   lapses where all logic gets thrown out the window.
                                 </p>

                                <div className="mt-5 text-center">
                                    <img src="/img/cold-emails.gif" className="img-fluied" />
                                </div>

                                <h3 className="mt-5">Sure you may want to be polite and tell the prospect about yourself, but there are many different many problems with it.</h3>

                                <p>
                                    <strong>The first is an issue with your cold email’s appearance.</strong>When you write a cold email, the average prospect decides if they are 
                                    going to read your email in 3 seconds, so why are you going to waste space explaining who you are in the first sentence?
                                    Most people do this at the beginning of their email, since an introduction is almost always at the beginning of things in life.
                                </p>

                                <div className="card blog-card">
                                    <div className="card-body">
                                        <img src="/img/star-ways-intro.jpg" className="img-fluied" />
                                        <small>I mean, what do you see first when you watch Star Wars right? Everything has an introduction.</small>
                                    </div>
                                </div>

                                <p className="mt-3">Here’s an example of an email I received from someone a few weeks ago:</p>

                                <div className="card blog-card">
                                    <div className="card-body">
                                        <img src="/img/bad-email.png" className="img-fluied" />
                                        <small>I can tell this is definitely a sales email (in this case this person is soliciting for a job/service) because it opens with an introduction.</small>
                                    </div>
                                </div>
                              
                                <p className="mt-3">
                                    I’m going to ignore that this prospect is trying to sell me on something we are trying to replace with LeadIQ, and just focus on the mistake of introducing themselves.
                                    Immediately, my eyes tell me it’s a sales email because they intro duce themselves.
                                </p>

                                <p className="mt-5">
                                    <strong>Another problem with introducing yourself in your emails is that it’s redundant.</strong> When you write a good cold email, you should explain who you are,
                                    but in one or two sentences tops. The best cold emails let their email signatures explain the real meat of who they are, and instead use the one sentence in their email
                                    to align a potential value proposition with their prospect.
                                </p>

                                <p>Now imagine if I wrote a bad email like some of the pitches I see how there with redundant info.</p>

                                <div className="text-center">
                                    <img src="/img/bad-email-from-ryan.png" className="img-fluied" />
                                </div>
                                 
                                <p className="mt-5">
                                    Space is precious on a cold email. The opportunity costs of using the first sentence to introduce myself is HUGE. I just blew my first impression sharing
                                    things that they could have seen in my email signature. Here’s me matching up the redundancies of my signature to the introduction for those wanting to see
                                    the different ways these things match up:
                                </p>

                                        <img src="/img/labeled-email.png" className="img-fluied"/>
                                        <small>You can see I matched up different aspects of the email the prospect could have discovered just by poking around my signature.</small>
                                    </div>
                                </div>

                                    Some of you are probably thinking, “I don’t even look at email signatures when I get emails from prospectors.” Next time you get an email that interests you, 
                                    watch where your mouse and eyes go after you finish reading the email. If copy compels someone enough, they always dig into the email more. They’ll click the links, 
                                    google the company, poke around, etc. We all have curiosity in us.
                                </p>

                                    We’ve talked about how introducing yourself makes your email look salesy. We discussed how if you have a solid email signature,
                                    it makes your copy redundant, and the opportunity costs. Now let’s talk about the biggest problem with introducing yourself in a cold email.
                                </p>

                                <h3 className="mt-5">Introducing yourself in a cold email is the easiest way to accidentally turn your cold email into a “<a href="/the-flaws-with-a-me-first-mentality-in-sales/">ME FIRST EMAIL."</a></h3>

                                <p>
                                    The flow of a cold email is super important, and when you writing your hearts out to win a prospect’s love, it’s very easy to slip into a 
                                    giant wall of text that’s focuses on you and your company, as oppose to your prospect and why they are special to you.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Try and write a cold email right now where you introduce yourself, and then not talk about your company’s services? It’s almost impossible to create 
                                    a smooth flow that’s easy to read. Emails that focus just on your company’s product or service are bad, and only work 3.5% of the time. If you want to 
                                    start seeing response rates go up, skip the introduction next time you write you cold email.
                                </p>

                                <p>You want to make sure your emails are more fun, mainly about your prospects, and most of all, human.</p>

                                <h3 className="mt-5">Here’s an example of selfless email that worked.</h3>

                                <p>
                                    I was following up with people I talked with at Saastr a few weeks back, and was trying to follow up with one of my favorite sites on the web is <a href="http://quora.com">Quora</a>
                                    I’ve been a Quora user since they launched many years ago, and was so pumped to finally meet their sales team. They recently just started selling ad space on their Q and A site, 
                                    which really excites me because users visiting their site have more intent than other platforms. We had a really quick stop and chat, but I had to think of way to get their attention 
                                    with the flood of Saastr follows they likely are getting.
                                </p>
                                <p>Rather than send a “let me introduce myself again” type email… I decided to have some fun with them. This was the cold email I wrote:</p>

                                <div className="card blog-card">
                                    <div className="card-body">
                                        <img src="/img/quora-email.png" className="img-fluied" />
                                        <small className="justify-content-center row">As you can see, I made the email mainly about the prospect. I swapped out the HTML in a Quora question I answered once with text about the prospect, then took a screenshot.</small>
                                    </div>
                                </div>

                               <p className="mt-5 mt-1">And of course, I got a reply:</p>

                                <div className="card blog-card">
                                    <div className="card-body">
                                        <img src="/img/quora-response.png" className="img-fluied"/>
                                        <small>Since I didn’t make the email about me, didn’t waste space on introducing myself to the prospect, we got the meeting.</small>
                                    </div>
                                </div>

                                <p className="mt-3">Introducing yourself in an email is a death sentence to your cold email. Make your emails about prospects, and remember space is precious!</p>
