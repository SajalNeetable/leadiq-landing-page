title: Why You Should Have Started Selling Yesterday
description: There’s a quintessential moment in the history of my startup, Ruvna, and it’s an experience I have sadly realized happens to many B2B startups. After speaking to anyone relevant to your recently launched app/company/whatever, you realize that you should have started truly selling your “world-changing” solution the minute you had something resembling an MVP.

First off, if your initial reaction is “my product isn’t ready” or “we will get funded and then hire someone to sell”, I have some bad news for you. You’re not a unicorn and you (more than likely) don’t have the personal reputation to successfully bring in funding without traction. To quote the great Jack Barker (whose theories are now taught in business schools), “There are two conjoined triangles of growth: Development and Sales.” Jokes aside, look at the data, it’s not pretty. Now that I’ve convinced you to start selling, back to the story.

Ruvna had been accepted into Dreamit’s spring 2016 cohort, and during our first managing director meeting (basically a 30-minute long “hot seat”), we received the question “What does your sales funnel looks like, and specifically how are you prospecting clients you think could turn into first adopters?”

“What does your sales funnel looks like, and specifically how are you prospecting clients you think could turn into first adopters?”

We gave the typical answer of “We have this great easy solution that is totally developed in house, and once it’s done we are going to raise and hire sales people”.

Without flinching, Mark Wacchen, one of the MDs, said “So you mean you THINK you have a great easy to use solution. Planning to raise without any validation, especially in EdTech, is as good as planning to fail”.

**My response: “Oh S\*\*t!”**

With it finally apparent to us that we needed to organize a serious pilot, we were in a bind. This was mid-march, and most schools set their budgets for the fall by April. An even more pressing problem however, was that the core of our teams skill set was not in the world of B2B sales! Looking back, I realize that had I known what questions to ask myself, I would have been in a much better position to succeed. So instead of making a tried and true “Step by step list to make your product sell!!” (of which there are plenty), I want to end with the most important thing I learned, and some good questions to ask yourself that might just help you figure out how to talk about your product.

At a basic level, early-stage startup sales efforts come down to ability to talk about the product, an accurate understanding of your customer’s pain points, and most of all **having a good product**.

While there are obviously more factors at play, in my humble opinion those are what it boils down to. There are a number of great easy-to-use prospecting tools (LeadIQ being a great example), CRM’s, marketing platforms, etc. But, none of that matters if you can’t easily explain what you’re selling and why someone should buy it. I don’t mean the classic “X” is the “Y” for “Z” (ex:Ubereats is the Uber for food).

While those one liners are fantastic for off-handedly describing what you do in a pinch, it’s not always that simple. I mean a real, nuanced understanding of why your solution is perfect for your customers AND the ability to explain your product in a relatable, friendly, and trustworthy way. Trust me, this is much easier said than done.

### To help you get to that point, here are the questions that some of the great mentors, advisors, and other founders posed to me:

*   Could you effectively explain your product to anyone in under 30 seconds?
*   What do you know about your customer’s pain that they don’t?
*   How SPECIFICALLY does your solution alleviate that pain, without adding in a new pain (I.E. annoying onboarding)
*   Do you know the language of your industry?
*   What does the procurement process look like?
*   What separates early adopters from the rest of your possible customer population?

Among these, the most important by far for early stage start-ups are the first and last question. As budding salespeople trying to do just that, you need to be able identify the traits your potential early adopts have. For

For Ruvna this happened to be primarily NYC independent schools with a heavy focus on technology, community leadership, and emergency preparedness to give an example. Your edge user with your fully developed product can, and will, be different than your first set of users, and speaking directly to them is how your first sales will be made.

Obviously, there is more to prospecting, connecting with, and eventually closing your first clients than I ever could mention here, but If you can confidently answer all of those questions, you’re better than I was 6 months ago!

Hopefully that helped, and if you have any questions or just want some clarification, I’ll do my best to respond. To finish the story, Ruvna [turned out alright](http://technical.ly/dc/2016/07/05/ruvna-pivot/) and we are going into the fall strong. Happy selling!
