title: The Easiest Way to Get Sales and Marketing Alignment
description: >-
  I remember last year I flew out to a sales and marketing org of a publicly
  traded company to do prospecting training. Out of respect for the company, I
  won’t mention them here, but I’ll tell you something I learned. Marketing and
  sales rarely get along, no matter how big the company is.

  This seems to be a reoccuring theme I see across many different companies. As
  a company gets bigger, so does the resentment.

  There seems to be a paradox that happens at all these companies.

  It’s this: Sales believes that marketing isn’t giving them good leads.
  Marketing believes that sales isn’t closing their leads.

  Today I’m going to talk about one of the easiest ways to get Sales and
  Marketing can get along.
