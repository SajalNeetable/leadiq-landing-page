title: How To Make Your Email Signature Stand Out
description: >-
  I’m always talking about how as a sales rep, you need to stand out and be
  interesting. If you are a VP of Sales and you’re running a team, you need your
  reps to have a brand, do tactics that make the prospect stop, and notice their
  interruption.

If you haven’t read one of our greatest hits blog posts, What Makes The Perfect Email Pitch https://leadiq.com/blog/what-makes-the-perfect-email-pitch, I say there are the four questions every cold email should answer. One of the toughest questions to answer is “Who are you?” 

If you talk about yourself too much, your email is doomed to get deleted or archived. If you miss the mark though, and don’t give enough trust or value to convince the person to respond, you are doomed as well. 

Today, I’m going to talk about your email signature, and how it can be a powerful weapon for prospecting.

## Why You Need An Email Signature

I don’t want to make this blog post about this, so I’ll try and keep this part short. An email signature is useful for a couple of reasons.

### Reason 1: Open Tracking

If your sales team is using any sort of software to track if someone is reading or opening your email, you’ll get a notifications whenever a prospect opens your email. I’m going to share something you probably don’t know. 

Most of these programs work by putting an invisible pixel in the body of your email that matches the white body of your email so the prospect can’t see it. 

When a user opens the email, it sends a notification back to the service you are using that the unique small pixel size image file has been queried and loaded. This then tells these companies’ servers that your prospect has opened the email. Each email you send creates a unique image file, which is how the service you are using knows what email was opened. 

The problem is, if there is no email signature with a logo or some other image file in it, and the user doesn’t have display images turned on in their settings tab, there could be a warning message asking the user to “display images.”
