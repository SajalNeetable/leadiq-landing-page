title: 'The Proper Way To Cold Email: My Trip To University of New Hampshire'
---
We tend to always put so much pressure on ourselves during the first day of school. When I was asked to join Ryan at University of New Hampshire for a talk. I freaked out, I had so many questions:

1. Will I fit in?
2. Is Katy Perry still a thing?
3. Do they know who Snoop Dogg is?
4. How do the kids dress now?


All these questions had nothing to do with the fact we were going there to teach. Also, I am at least 7 years older then all those kids. Why am I so needy for acceptance?  I realized in that moment, we always tend to fall back into our old habits.


## Rate My Pitch

It’s so interesting how people love to cram everything about themselves in one shot, email after email. Each one looking as if they were all asked to send in their memoirs. I’m positive one of the students spoke about her wisdom teeth being removed and how that’s made her a better person. What?! That’s crazy! I understand you are trying to sell yourself, but the point of your first cold email is to not sell your product. It’s to get a response, get a conversation started. 

We went through a few of the students emails, and discussed the issues. 90% of all those emails were too long, they were at least 3-4 lengthy paragraphs, but to their credit majority of the business world writes like they do. 

We live in this bubble we tend to forget people really do not care for us as much we would like them to. They just want to see quick samples from everyone. Think of a cold email like food samples at the mall, the idea of the sample is to give you a small taste for what is about to come at you if you bought that meal. 



The idea is to wet your appetite, or as the french say “amuse bouche”. Yes! I can write in french, with google translate I am able to write anything in any language. 

What blows my mind is most people don’t realize and what Ryan pointed out was “most people read their emails on their phone.” So you basically have the entire length of a phone screen to grab someone's attention. That’s crazy short, you’re better off typing your email in an Instagram post or twitter. But that’s the world we live in, ask yourself what would you rather answer?

The shorter the better, another few points Ryan had on their cold emails was to cut out the fat. Even in our everyday lives  we have so much fat to cut out, conversationally speaking. 

When you write an email most of the time it does not makes sense to introduce yourself. You have all your name and information below, that’s like when that random guy on Facebook reaches out and introduces himself you know there is something off about that. 

Also, most of the emails didn’t have any personalization, these students made the same mistake most professionals make their emails were all about them and what they can do. It was a “ME...Me...Me” email. Which made their emails unbearable to read, as tough as that was to say it’s true. But even after all that, the last crucial part I think these students and many Sales reps have was their closing, each and every one of the emails we critiqued had a weak closer. 

“If you had some time would love to speak with you hopefully next week about using my services.” 

NEVER ASK. ALWAYS ASSUME, BE CONFIDENT! 

Saying statements like “would love to…” or “If you get a chance” … or even “If you had some time next week, would love to…” All of these sell underconfidence and gives the person an out of the conversation.
