title: 'The Proper Way To Cold Email: My Trip To University of New Hampshire'
---
We tend to always put sooo much pressure on ourselves during the first day of school. When I was asked to join Ryan at University of New Hampshire for a talk. I freaked out, I had so many questions:

Will I fit in?
Is Katy Perry still a thing?
Do they know who Snoop Dogg is?
How do the kids dress now?

All these questions had nothing to do with the fact we were going there to teach. Also, I am at least 7 years older then all those kids. Why am I so needy for love?  I realized in that moment, we always tend to fall back into our old habits.
