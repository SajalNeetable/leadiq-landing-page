Yet over 84% of executives at companies have purchased something that was first introduced to them via cold outreach. </p>
                                    <p className="labelUniversityOne">Our jobs as prospectors is quietly super nobel. Every new opportunity that you generate could potentially create anywhere from 1-10+ new jobs depending on your average deal size. We’ve talked to some Sales Development Reps with yearly quotas was over 30x their salary. We’re money makers, but more importantly, we’re building our economy.</p>
                                    <p className="labelUniversityOne">While some of those stats earlier seem grim, the best prospectors in the entire world can score double digit response rates with their outreach. They make prospects feel loved, they smash quota goals, but most of all, they feel good about what they do when they wake up in the morning.</p>
                                    <p className="labelUniversityOne">That’s where we want all prospectors to be. We want to help you get more wins everyday.One activity at a time, we want prospects to hate saying “no” to you. We want to change the stigma that prospecting is a dirty job. That’s why we build LeadIQ, and why we’re sharing this University.

                                    <p className="labelUniversityOne">Prospecting shouldn’t be about pressing a bunch of numbers, making a bunch of dials, and sending emails written by someone else. It should be about connecting with others, making them feel good, and showing them why you worth their time, money, and interest.</p>

                                    <p className="labelUniversityOne">I’m going to assume most of you already do this, but just as a quick refresher, Account-based prospecting is the reverse of prospecting to a large pool of prospects. It’s when you find the best companies to go after prior to reaching out to employees at that company.</p>
                                    <p className="mb-3 labelUniversityOne">Before even thinking about the role of your ideal customer eg: Finance Directors you will consider account-based factors, such as:</p>

                                    <p className="labelUniversityOne">If you are implementing research first prospecting you are practicing thoughtful prospecting. Awesome job. It’s surprising that sales teams are still pulling large amounts of data to send out mass email campaigns or picking up the phone to dial a prospect without knowing anything other than their contact information.</p>
                                    <p className="mt-4 labelUniversityOne">There is no substitute for research. Not ever. No matter how cool you think a new sales prospecting tool is to maximize your impact on outreach you need to research your prospects individually not en masse.

Some teams from a data perspective may even be using more than one source for data. A good way to think about Database solutions vs. LeadIQ is sort of like a fish market vs. a fishing rod.</p>

Typically database solutions will collect data that sits stale for months or even years. When you pull data in real time you get the most up to date contact information. Depending on your prospecting activities accurate data is going to save you time and lots of energy. Why pull 1k contacts with a 30% bounce rate when you can find 800 contacts with a 5% bounce rate.  You also aren’t spamming your servers with a bunch of bounces.</p>
