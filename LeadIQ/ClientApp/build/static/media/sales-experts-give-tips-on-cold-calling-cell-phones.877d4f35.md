title: Sales Experts Give Tips on Cold Calling Cell Phones
description: Over the past few months, we’ve had a lot customers come in and buy LeadIQ just for our phone data. It wasn’t always like this. I think a big reason for this shift has been because direct dials are becoming less and less relevant thanks to companies moving away from desk phones. So what kind of phone data are they buying?

Companies are now using cell phone numbers to skip gatekeepers, and sure enough, we’ve find it a bit easier to get this data with our algorithms. One of the most frequently asked question I get is how do you approach selling and cold calling on a cell phone effectively?

### Tip #1: Ask for permission

“When you cold call a cell phone it’s important to start off with a strong lead in and pre call research just like you would any other call. The permission to continue part is most important here. You can say something like, “I know I caught you out of the blue so I’ll be brief.”

### Tip #2: Aim for a smile

“Here are four mini tips:

1\. Starts with my name and company

2\. Then a statement that answers their #1 question which is “do I know this person” (we’ve never met).

3\. The trigger or reason for the call and

4\. A question that’s a bit funny aimed at getting a smile. “

### Tip #3: Follow-up with a text

Example: “Mike, Cory Bray from ClozeLoop. Just left a VM. We’re working with CEOs who are frustrated with their sales team’s ability to hit revenue targets. If that sounds like you, want chat for 15 minutes and see if we can help?”

### Tip #4: Know your boundaries

“You should have boundaries, if they say in their voicemail to only use their cell for emergencies then don’t call to prospect them at that number. Your monthly number might feel like an emergency, but not to them also, I wouldn’t send them a text, unless you got the go ahead or they say so in their VM.”

### Tip #5: Be ready!

“When calling a cell be prepared for two things. First, there’s a much higher likelihood that the prospect will answer – be ready! Second, get right to the point, book the meeting and get off the phone.”

### Tip #6: Find something universal

“Find something that’s universal to everyone you’re calling – but comes off as fresh and original. It’s about them and you all at once.”

### Tip #7: Think outside the box

“One tool I use is called Keynectup. Instead of using business cards, I give people a key to text to get my information. When they text the code, they can get all my social information so that they know who I am. But if they don’t do a download of the information, I can still get their phone number. This is a great tool for relationship building. Then, when I call, I can say “Hey, its James Buckley at Cirrus, it was great connecting.”
