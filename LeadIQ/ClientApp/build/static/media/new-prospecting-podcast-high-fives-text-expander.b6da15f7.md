title: New Prospecting Podcast High Fives with Text Expander
description: A few months ago, a customer of ours, Scott Smith, VP of Sales from CloudApp changed my life. As a marketer, I was losing time having to do annoying copying and pasting for link tracking activities, and remembering how to add code to the end of links for tracking was super hard for me

As a prospector, I found myself having to lose time every day getting URLs for bookmarks, responding with boilerplate level things involving LeadIQ, and dealing with crappy formatting issues with copying and pasting things into emails.

Then that one day, Scott suggested I check out this app called TextExpander, and my whole life changed.

I’m honored to have interviewed [Mike Burda](http://twitter.com/mikeburda), who runs all things sales for [TextExpander](http://textexpander.com)‘s company, Smile Software in this most recent episode of The Prospecting Podcast.
