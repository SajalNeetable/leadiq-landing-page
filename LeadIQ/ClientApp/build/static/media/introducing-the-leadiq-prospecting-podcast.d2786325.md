Many moons again, we told you all that we want to make prospecting better for everyone.

Prospecting today is in a bad place. Reps are sending millions of thoughtless emails

Many moons again, we told you all that we want to make prospecting better for everyone.

Prospecting today is in a bad place. Reps are sending millions of thoughtless emails everyday, prospects are getting ticked off at the lack of fun, value, and the logical friendliness in emails.

Ultimately it’s making it harder for sales teams that send legitimate personal prospecting emails to be successful. **We want to change this**.

The goal of this podcast is to show off some cool sales technology that can help you spend more time being personal and personable, share some of the prospecting efforts we’ve been executing, and introduce you to some really cool guests practicing unorthodox prospecting techniques.

Every bad email we all send hurts all of us. Let’s make prospecting pleasurable for prospects and sales teams.

### So how do I listen to the podcast?

So [LeadIQ is using Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/leadiq/) to host the podcast. Feel free to follow us there if you are trying to get your prospecting podcast fix on.

In our first episode, we talked with co-founder and seasoned sales vet, Braydan Young, about prospecting and his techniques he uses for [CoffeeSender.com.](http://coffeesender.com/)

CoffeeSender.com is pretty cool. They make it super easy for you to send coffee to your customers, and track it via Starbucks giftcards.

You also can download the podcast on iTunes if you’d prefer [here.](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/podcast-1-high-fives-coffeesender/id1126111869?i=1000371071726&mt=2)
