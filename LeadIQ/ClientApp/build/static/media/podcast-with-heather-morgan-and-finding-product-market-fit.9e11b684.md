In this episode, we’ll talk about some best practices in cold email, how Heather found her groove, and also using prospecting to discover your product market fit . Listen up here:

### A few comments post podcast and using prospecting to find product market fit:

One of the things people always talk about in startups is product market fit. This is whether or not your product has a fit for its respected market. In theory, if your product has product market fit, you’ll not only see customers buying your product, but telling others about it. These customers should have similar characteristics.

Heather brings up a really interesting point about some of the B2B startups that approach her for writing cold emails actually think they have product market fit when they don’t.

Think about like this:

How many startups out there have 40-50 accounts using them, but still struggle to get opportunities?

Just because your company has 40-50 customers under contract does not necessarily mean you have a your own place in the market. If you’re a new sales team figuring things out, it may not hurt to talk with your existing base of customers and find out why they chose your product over a competitor’s. Did they come in because they are friends with the founder? Do they share an investor with you? Are they someone you had a previous or personal relationship with?

These numbers can easily add up to be 40-50 enterprise customers, and may give a mirage of product market fit. The problem is, often times, at least in Heather Morgan’s experience, it’s just that: a mirage of product market fit.

If you aren’t getting replies on your cold emails, but you follow some of the best practices we talk about, there is always the possibility that your company simply hasn’t figured out who it serves best, or maybe your company needs to tweak a few things in the product.

If this is the case, the good news is prospecting is a good way to easily explore whether you have product market fit yet or not. While I love personalization, it doesn’t hurt to write a cold email to a subset of certain types of people with a hypothesis of whether they are a good prospect or not, and send a smaller template out.

### Test it! Build a list really quick, try a simple value prop, and see if it yields more replies.

When LeadIQ first started, I remember sending a 50 email blast to a bunch of companies who were using a complimentary tool that overlapped with LeadIQ. I started seeing a glimmer of hope, not doing much personalization, and still yielding a 19% reply rate. 30% of those replies turned into opportunities. That experiment taught me that our tool capturing leads right into Salesforce was a feature sales teams wanted most.

If you see an increase in replies that convert into opportunities, and the group is big enough, double down on it, and add personalization as you get a glimpse of product market fit.

As we mention in the podcast, the more competitive the market is, the more personalization you’ll have to do.

Hope you enjoy this episode. Please tell your friends about it!
