title: Content Proven to Work for Prospecting
description: We know content helps with prospecting. Case studies – great. Video – even better. Blog posts like this one, super okay. But how do you usually find the right thing to send or talk about when you are about to send an email or make a call? When you get that prospect list from LeadIQ, well, what do you say to them

Something like 40+ hours a month are spent by sales reps looking for content. Does that sound familiar? Oh, no. How can we bring that number down so you are spending more time on what you do best – core selling?

We took a look at a huge number of engagements by prospects and shares of content by sales reps like you. How many? The number is pretty big.

 We all have been there. Using case studies for content.

**1 Million Content Engagements & Shares**

Our research revealed some useful things about what kind of content you can share and when. There are two ways of looking at what content is popular – by prospect profile, and by content types.

**By Prospect Profile**

_Industry_

The top content type that prospects from companies in the technology industry want was white papers. For prospects in non-technology companies, it was implementation guides. Videos are also 50% more likely to be viewed by prospects in non-technology industries, while technology companies were about 60% more likely to use buyer’s guides.

_Junior-level Versus Senior-level_

Top content for junior-level prospects was a dead heat between presentations and implementation guides, while datasheets and implementation guides tied for popularity with senior-level prospects. Junior-level prospects prefer infographics 2X more than their senior-level peers.

**By Content Types**

_Video_

We found that while sales reps were likely to share video mostly during the early stage of the sales process, which is effective, video is a late stage winner for engaging prospects too. What videos do you have available to share that explain the business case you need to lay out at the late stage? Do you need more of this kind of video content?

_Datasheets_

Don’t underestimate datasheets. They are a given, but our research showed they are effective! Bottom line: Prospects need these to build their business case.

_Third-party Content_

While we found sales reps are much more likely to share third-party content at the early stage, prospects are far more likely to actually look at it in the late stage. Consider using that third-party content (that lends you credibility from another source) in a later stage for better prospect engagement.
