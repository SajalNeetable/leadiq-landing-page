Throughout my internship this summer, I have seen some very carefully crafted cold emails that happened to convert prospects to opportunities. Sales is often times too automated. With cadences being sent out by the thousands, and call centers spamming decision makers all the time, to get a phone call that is actually full of consideration is refreshing.

There’s one problem with cold calling however… Instead of being left on read, or having the prospect get cold, the prospect will give every objection in the book to try and avoid the phone call. Ryan O’Hara and Jeremy Leveille give a good demonstration on objections in cold calls in this mock call. They give some valuable commentary at the end about how each could have improved.
