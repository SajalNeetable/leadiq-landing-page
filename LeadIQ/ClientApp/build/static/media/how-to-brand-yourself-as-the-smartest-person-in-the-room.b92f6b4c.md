As mentioned earlier, the Sage brand archetype is all about being enlightened with wisdom, and teaching others about it. If your goal is push intelligence as a main way to build your brand, and be the smartest person in the room, this is a pretty good archetype to consider

I’m going to assume if you are reading this, you likely saw this post on [brand archetypes](https://leadiq.com/2018/09/an-introduction-to-brand-archetyping-for-social-selling/). Keep in mind, there are plenty of people out there that push and teach people about things online.[Cory Bray who we brought up](https://leadiq.com/2018/09/how-to-brand-yourself-as-rebel-brand/) in the last archetype blog post teaches people about sales development all the time. However, he isn’t a Sage brand. It’s all about how you word things, and frame your posts around knowledge.

Sage brands focus on the lessons, sharing information, and learning. Sages constantly seek wisdom from others, and share theirs based on experience.

I’m going to show you an example of a brand and few employees lining up their archetypes together. Let’s peek at the company Oracle.

_Oracle’s company name literally is a synonym with the word “sage.”_

Oracle is all about sharing things that enlighten their customers. They teach customers how to do things, and how things work. They are teachers educating the world about their dozens of industries they are in. Many of their employees use their company’s archetype to inspire them for post.

_A post from [Abhiram Annangi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhiramannangi/) fits with Oracle’s brand of teaching people._

The way they frame products and value proposition is delivered all around intelligence.

_Just quickly sampling some of Oracle’s product line, you can easily see intelligence being an important part of their value._

Extending off of Oracle, one person who fits the brand archetype well online is my former boss, GM of Oracle’s Cloud division, [Kyle York](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyork20/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_top%3Bxcl7J3OHSDiHY8KajpDmJA%3D%3D&licu=urn%3Ali%3Acontrol%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_top-search_srp_result&lici=88B3KCVySrSes8AeP210Hg%3D%3D).

York is constantly sharing lessons he’s learned on his rise to a leadership role, and has a loyal following thanks to wisdom. This is lined up with the Oracle brand perfectly.

_Kyle York could have focused his post on breaking the rules with t-shirts instead of suits. That’s not the way he frames his post however. He frames it around teaching a lesson, and being a Sage to those interested in sales, business, and entrepreneurship._

The word ”lesson” is used often to reinforce that York is a sage that is worth listening to:

_York again posting about lessons. This is a big part of his online brand, and it fits perfectly with Oracle’s online brand. You don’t have to align with your company, but when you do it, can work wonderfully._

York aligning with his company’s brand has helped him build a great following online, and it can be an important part of the puzzle.

### You don’t have to pick the same archetype as your company, but you can.

Earlier I mentioned how I ended up picking an archetype for myself instead of rolling with Dyn’s archetype. I got a lot pushback talking with brand archetype experts on this, but I can tell you this. As a seller, it’s helped me a ton doing something on my own vs. my company.

However, if you do pick an archetype that matches your company, you can, and that’s ok. If you switch companies, that shouldn’t cause you to change your in archetype.

Sage brands can show off their wisdom, and seem confident.
