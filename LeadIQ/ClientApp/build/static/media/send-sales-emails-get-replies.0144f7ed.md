For those that don’t know Will, Will is probably the best sales podcaster out there. Between working super hard, listening to new ideas, and digging up great speakers, it’s hard to beat his content. You should definitely take a listen to what Will is doing.

Sales is changing, and Will gets it. We’re all up against the machines, and we’re on a mission to try and beat the machines to save selling for humanity.

Imagine a world where prospects like getting prospected? Selling is all about being human, and you can’t outsource that, or train automation to do it.

That’s some of the things we talk about on the most recent episode of Will’s podcast, along with how our team gets double digit reply rate.

Take a listen below:

Some other things we talk about:

*   Why researching leads upfront means your more effective at the closing stage
*   Why you should share your emails you write with colleagues, and even friends?
