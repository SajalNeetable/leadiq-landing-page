In the past, we’ve spent a lot of time on prospecting tactics, sales tools, hacks to be more efficient, and how to deal with objections. We decided this time around to focus on something else; strategically deciding who is best to prospect.

On this episode of the Prospecting Podcast, Marylou and Ryan talk about picking the right accounts when prospecting. This was major theme as teams shift into account based prospecting, and account based selling.

Marylou spent a ton of time conducting research for her new book, Predictable Prospecting, and so we discussed some of the research as well. Take a listen below.
