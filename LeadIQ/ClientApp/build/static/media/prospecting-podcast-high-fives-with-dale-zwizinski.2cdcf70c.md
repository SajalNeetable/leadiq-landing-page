description: A few years back, I first met Dale when he was working at a competitor of ours, Kitedesk. I loved the content and posts that Dale made so I asked him to be on our podcast. Now working at Oracle, Dale I deep dove into what makes a good prospecting, and how it differs with big vs. small companies, a place Dale has deep experience with.
