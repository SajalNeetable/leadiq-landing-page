Although, it seems like something that comes natural to her, I have learned that it is part of a process that she has developed over time.

“If you can get them to laugh, you’ll be in good shape!”

— Elizabeth Ostby; Account Executive, Salesforce

One of the things I have noticed is that she uses humor to break the ice in both written and verbal communication. From prospects to UBER drivers, she is always making people laugh with light and non-offensive jokes. It is hard to dislike someone who makes you laugh. It gives her the opportunity to quickly build rapport and build trust.

As an analytical person this simple advice just seems too simple. In spite of those misconceptions, I have seen this work in both her personal and professional life. Since my overly serious method was just not working I decided to start incorporating her methods into my prospecting process.

As we all know getting someone’s attention through email is becoming increasingly difficult. Light, non-offensive humor is a good way to standout in a sea of emails. Below is a widely used template I was given that has been very effective in getting prospect responses.

This an email Elizabeth uses with solid reply rates.

### Why This Email Works

1\. The subject line stands out in a sea of emails.

2\. It is focused on the action you want the prospect to take.

3\. It incorporates humor in a clever way.

4\. Finally, it is funny.

Since this email is widely used, I would recommend crafting a version that is authentic to your style and personality. It is important to realize that you are building a relationship with a person. Ultimately, people do business with people they know and trust. Becoming effective at quickly building trust will greatly increase your conversion rate both on and offline.Getting to No FasterWith the aid of tools like LeadIQ I am very purposeful in my prospecting. I do not like people to waste my time and I try to extend that courtesy to others. When I reach out to someone I reach out to them to offer them a service I believe they could benefit from. Using the template above has helped me get to no faster.

I would recommend crafting a version that is authentic to your style and personality. It is important to realize that you are building a relationship with a person.

By incorporating humor into my emails prospects feel more comfortable being honest. They will often tell exactly where I stand in the process. This information is invaluable. Ultimately, if I am not a contender for a project it is beneficial to know as soon as possible, so I can direct my effort to more promising prospects.The IntangiblesIn our data driven society I think we lose site of the value of building relationships. It is not always easy to calculate the short term ROI of a long term relationship. From my own experience I can say that incorporating humor into my process has made the process more enjoyable for both my clients and myself.I would love to hear about your stories of how incorporating humor into your process has increased either the tangible or intangible aspects of your business.
