title: Prospecting Jam Session with Michael Pullman from Zuus Dynamic Scheduling
description: I remember when I first joined LeadIQ, I did a lot of prospecting to find early adopters for our product. This is how businesses are grown. It’s not about big wins, it’s about little wins everyday. Positive replies, positive phone calls, positive demoes, closed conversions, then customer referrals. If you can get enough of these, you may just figure out a way to stay around.

One of the better friendships we’ve formed here has been with a creative, smart, and charismatic guy named [Michael Pullman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelpullman/), who works at [Zuus Dynamic Scheduling](https://www.zuusworkforce.com/). They’ve been able to grow their team strictly with outbound. This prospecting jam session is a little bit more focused on using our product, but there are some cool ideas here about event prospecting, plus using social selling and connection data to break in.
